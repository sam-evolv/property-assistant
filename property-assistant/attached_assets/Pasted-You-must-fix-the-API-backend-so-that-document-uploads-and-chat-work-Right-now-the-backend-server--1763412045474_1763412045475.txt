You must fix the API backend so that document uploads and chat work.  
Right now the backend server is NOT running because packages/api/package.json does not contain a "dev" script.  
When I run “cd packages/api && npm run dev” the shell shows “npm ERR! missing script: dev”.  
This causes 500 errors for /api/train and 401 errors for /api/chat, because the server is not running.

I need you to perform the following actions exactly:

1. OPEN FILE:
   packages/api/package.json

2. INSPECT the "scripts" section.  
   If a "dev" script does not exist, ADD this script exactly:

   "dev": "ts-node-esm src/index.ts",

   Do NOT remove other scripts.  
   If a "scripts" block already exists, insert this inside it.

3. VERIFY that the entrypoint src/index.ts exists.  
   If it does not, locate the correct startup file and update the dev script accordingly.

4. ENSURE the backend actually runs on port 3001 by doing one of the following:
   - Confirm src/index.ts listens on 3001, OR
   - Update the server to listen on process.env.PORT || 3001.

5. AFTER fixing the script, RUN this command in the Shell:
   cd packages/api && npm run dev

6. CONFIRM via Shell logs:
   - API server starts
   - No “missing script” error
   - Database connected
   - Routes mounted: /api/train, /api/chat
   - Server listening on port 3001

7. FIX any TypeScript errors or missing imports that prevent startup.
   The API must successfully compile and run.

8. TEST the endpoints internally:
   - Call POST /api/train with a small test payload
   - Call POST /api/chat with a test message
   - Confirm both return 200 responses

9. THEN FIX the developer portal so that it targets the now-running backend.  
   Ensure all API calls use relative paths:
   fetch("/api/train")
   fetch("/api/chat")
   and NOT localhost or absolute URLs.

10. CONFIRM end-to-end by guiding me to upload a PDF in the Developer Portal and receive a valid training job response.

Deliverables:
- Updated package.json (show the modified scripts block)
- Summary of changes
- Shell log screenshot (or inline output) showing the API server running
- Confirmation that /api/train and /api/chat now respond successfully
- Confirmation that upload + chat works from the Developer Portal

Execute all steps now and restart anything needed.
