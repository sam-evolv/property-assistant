You are restoring ONLY the Purchaser Portal (apps/unified-portal) to the exact UI/UX style and component architecture shown in the reference images below. Everything must match the earlier Seaview-style design: clean, white, polished, minimalistic, modern. This restoration applies ONLY to the tenant-facing portal. Do NOT modify the super-admin, developer admin, backend API routes, or database.

REFERENCE IMAGES (style, layout, components):
1. /mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 16.10.31.png
2. /mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 16.10.42.png
3. /mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 16.10.50.png
4. /mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 16.10.57.png
These reflect the correct layout, spacing, typography, components, UX behaviours, and visual hierarchy.

YOUR OBJECTIVE:
Completely revert the Purchaser Portal to the original design Sam created — NOT any of the yellow UI or incorrect revisions. Every screen must be rebuilt to match the Seaview-style reference.

CORE RULE:
If a component in the current code does NOT match the reference images or original design, DELETE IT and rebuild it cleanly.

-----------------------------------
### 1. RESTORE THE CHAT HOMESCREEN (MOST IMPORTANT)
Rebuild the Chat Home exactly like the Seaview reference:
- Remove ANY yellow/gold bubbles, icons, headers, or gradients
- No double toolbars or top bars
- NO giant question buttons dominating the screen
- Layout must be:

   - Centered logo  
   - “Welcome to Longview Park” title  
   - Subtext in smaller grey font  
   - Four pill-style quick prompts (small, subtle pills – not massive buttons)  
   - Chat input at the bottom with microphone icon  
   - Tabs: Chat | Map | Notice | Docs (matching Seaview style)

- Restore the real text input box.
- Restore dictation/microphone functionality.
- The Chat engine must answer questions correctly and use RAG documents.
- Greeting should include property address + house type.

-----------------------------------
### 2. FIX MAPS TAB — FULL GOOGLE MAPS RESTORATION
Replace the current broken mapping system with:
- REAL Google Maps (JavaScript SDK)
- Load automatically to the user’s home location (from unit.address)
- TOP FILTER BAR identical to Seaview (horizontal scroll pills):
   Banking, Bars, Cafés, DIY, Dog Park, Schools, EV Charging, Fuel, Shopping, Parks, Medical, etc.
- Map markers must populate automatically based on category pressed.
- No thumbnails, no giant buttons, no yellow UI.
- Remove wrong addresses (currently showing “2 Longview Park” for everyone)
- Remove OSM references entirely.

-----------------------------------
### 3. FIX DOCUMENTS TAB — REAL DOCUMENT LOGIC
Documents must load from Supabase:
- If document filename contains the user’s houseType (BD01, BD02, AL03 etc.) → show it.
- If document is general (no house type tag) → show it for everyone.
- Use clean grid layout exactly like reference screenshots.
- Fix all errors at bottom of screen.
- No yellow icons or oversized spacing.

-----------------------------------
### 4. FIX NOTICEBOARD TAB (IDENTICAL TO REFERENCE)
- Replace entire screen with Seaview-style design:
   - Clean white cards, modern shadows
   - Category filters at top (All, Event, Lost & Found, Alert, Buy/Sell, Service, General)
   - Floating blue + button bottom-right
   - No top yellow header
- Restore full post creation workflow.
- Ensure notices reflect ONLY the user’s development.

-----------------------------------
### 5. LANGUAGE SWITCHING
Full restoration:
- EN dropdown top-right using flag + caret
- When changed:
   - All UI labels change (Chat, Map, Notices, Docs)
   - Chat queries pass language hint to backend
   - Maps filter pills are translated

-----------------------------------
### 6. REMOVE EVERYTHING THE SYSTEM ADDED THAT WAS NOT REQUESTED
This includes:
- Yellow colour scheme
- Yellow header
- Oversized question buttons
- Wrong icons
- Wrong fonts
- Double toolbars
- Broken address rendering
- OSM map implementation
- Missing chat input box
- Missing microphone
- Empty docs and errors
- Any layout not matching reference images

-----------------------------------
### 7. DEPENDENCIES & FIXES
- Ensure Google Maps SDK loads with the portal’s API key from env
- Fix any missing imports for icons/components
- Remove unused styles from previous attempts
- Repair any React errors preventing docs from loading
- Ensure unit context loads correctly from QR URL → home → chat

-----------------------------------
### 8. DELIVERABLE
At the end you must produce:
- Clean, restored Chat Home matching reference images
- Working Maps with real Google Maps + filter pills
- Working Documents with correct filtering logic
- Working Noticeboard with modern cards
- Working language dropdown
- Clean bottom tab bar with no extra top bars

This must look polished, premium, modern, and consistent — EXACTLY like the reference design Sam originally created, only cleaner.

DO NOT TOUCH:
- Developer Dashboard
- Super Admin Portal
- RAG Index
- Training Jobs
- Backend migrations
- Auth logic beyond QR login flow

ONLY Purchaser Portal UI/UX.
