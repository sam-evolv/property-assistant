## OBJECTIVE
Upgrade the entire UI and UX to deliver a **fully polished, single-screen app experience** that feels as refined and fluid as ChatGPT or an iOS native app.  
No scrolling should be required on any main view (Chat, Map, Noticeboard, Documents).  
All interfaces should be visually balanced, equally spaced, and aesthetically premium.

---

## TASKS

### 1. ✅ GLOBAL EXPERIENCE & LAYOUT

- Lock viewport to a **single screen** (100vh height).
- Remove unnecessary scroll behaviour across all routes.
- Use Flexbox or Grid with `h-screen` containers to vertically center content.
- Adjust chat page so the input bar and conversation area fit within the screen naturally — no overflow or scroll required.
- Add smooth, minimal transitions between pages (fade or slide).

```tsx
<main className="h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center overflow-hidden bg-white dark:bg-neutral-950 transition-colors duration-300">
Maintain persistent top bar (logo + language + theme toggle) and bottom dock.

Center the chat area vertically with subtle breathing space above/below.

2. ✅ BOTTOM NAVIGATION POLISH
Evenly distribute the four buttons perfectly (equal spacing on all screen widths).

Reduce icon size slightly for refinement (h-5 w-5 on desktop, h-4 w-4 on mobile).

Tighten vertical spacing so text labels sit closer to icons.

Add smooth hover + active feedback (scale 1.05, colour fade).

Ensure the dock never overlaps content (reserve bottom padding where needed).

3. ✅ CHAT INTERFACE (FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE)
Build Chat view like ChatGPT:

Fixed full-height viewport.

Chat area fills space above input bar.

Input bar always visible and anchored to bottom dock.

Centered placeholder message (“Ask about your home or community…”).

Animate input bar focus — gentle lift and shadow (translateY(-2px)).

Add subtle background gradient behind messages.

Use soft borders + translucent background (bg-white/80 dark:bg-neutral-900/80).

Provide auto-scroll for messages only (inner container scroll, not page scroll).

4. ✅ MAP INTERFACE UPGRADE
Redesign Map screen to feel premium and integrated:

Embed map container with rounded corners and shadow.

Add white translucent overlay bar with subtle icons for “Refine Area” or “Filters”.

Replace basic buttons with rounded glass buttons (backdrop-blur-md bg-white/40 dark:bg-neutral-800/50 border border-white/20).

Typography: smaller, semi-bold, and neutral grey.

Layout example:

tsx
Copy code
<div className="h-full w-full relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <div className="absolute top-4 left-0 right-0 flex justify-center gap-3">
    <button className="px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full backdrop-blur-md bg-white/50 dark:bg-neutral-800/50 text-sm text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 shadow-sm">
      Refine Area
    </button>
    <button className="px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full backdrop-blur-md bg-white/50 dark:bg-neutral-800/50 text-sm text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 shadow-sm">
      Local Amenities
    </button>
  </div>
  <div id="map" className="w-[90%] h-[75%] rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden"></div>
</div>
5. ✅ NOTICEBOARD REDESIGN
Make it bright, structured, and visually engaging:

Replace solid black with dynamic background that adapts to light/dark mode.

Cards for each notice with white or neutral surfaces, slight shadows.

Add “Add Notice” button with floating action style (bottom-right corner).

Ensure all text uses proper colour contrast (dark mode readable).

Example card style:

tsx
Copy code
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900 border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-4 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition">
  <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">Notice Title</h3>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1">Notice description…</p>
</div>
6. ✅ DOCUMENTS PAGE POLISH
Modernize the layout:

Replace plain list with styled document cards (pdf, docx, etc. icons).

Add file-type icon, title, and “View / Download” buttons inline.

Consistent spacing and subtle hover effects.

Use the same visual system as Noticeboard (light/dark adaptive cards).

Optionally add a search bar (Search documents…) at top.

7. ✅ VISUAL COHESION
All four main pages share:

Matching paddings + margins.

Consistent max-w-xl constraint for central elements.

Font sizes: use text-base for primary content, text-sm for secondary.

Rounded corners (rounded-xl) everywhere for consistency.

Use same elevation system: shadow-sm → shadow-md on hover.

Soft transitions (transition-all duration-200).

8. ✅ DARK MODE TUNING
Ensure every surface, button, and text has a dark-mode variant.

Use neutral, deep greys instead of true black.

Chat background → bg-neutral-950/95

Map overlays and cards adapt to dark:bg-neutral-800/50.

Noticeboard and Document cards should invert cleanly between modes.

9. ✅ PERFORMANCE & BEHAVIOUR
Optimize map rendering (defer loading until visible).

Ensure transitions between pages don’t reset layout flickers.

Keep persistent Dock + Header mounted at all times (no re-render flicker).

Ensure consistent 60fps transitions (use CSS transitions only).

10. ✅ COMMIT MESSAGE
pgsql
Copy code
feat(ui): upgrade all main pages to polished single-screen layout with refined dock, chat-like input, and premium light/dark UI parity
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Chat screen behaves like ChatGPT: one static viewport, no page scroll, polished input bar interaction.

Bottom dock perfectly balanced (equal spacing, crisp icons, active state highlight).

Map screen feels refined with translucent overlays and better buttons.

Noticeboard and Documents have light/dark adaptive card designs.

Entire app feels cohesive, fast, and “native.”
