You are now executing PHASE 10 of the OpenHouse AI SaaS Transformation.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Complete ALL remaining developer-facing functionality in the Developer Portal so the product behaves like a real SaaS system. This includes fully stable CRUD, UI flows, form submissions, error states, routing, and RBAC-visible elements.

DO NOT touch the Tenant Portal QR onboarding security implementation yet — that will be Phase 11.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 10 OBJECTIVES:

1. Finalise Developer CRUD UI and Server Actions
   - Developers (admin users)
   - Developments
   - Homeowners
   Ensure ALL create, update, delete flows:
     • Submit successfully
     • Redirect properly
     • Show success and error states
     • Validate input
     • Enforce RBAC checks
     • Are wired to server actions only (NO client-side Supabase calls)

2. Replace ALL remaining client-side data fetching with server components.
   Every dashboard or list page should be:
      - A server component
      - Fetching using the session + supabase server client
      - Passing props into small client components

3. Build Missing Form Components
   Verify and/or create:
      apps/developer-portal/app/admin/developers/[id]/form.tsx
      apps/developer-portal/app/admin/developments/[id]/form.tsx
      apps/developer-portal/app/admin/homeowners/[id]/form.tsx
   Ensure consistent props:
      { mode: "create" | "edit", initialData?: any }

4. Build Navigation Shell + Roles
   - Finalise the sidebar/topbar layout
   - Hide or show menu items based on role
   - Ensure logout works
   - Ensure breadcrumbs and titles are correct

5. Error Boundaries + Validation
   - Add try/catch around all server actions
   - Add meaningful error messages
   - Add form-level validation

6. Routing Finalisation
   Test and fix:
      /admin
      /admin/developers
      /admin/developers/new
      /admin/developers/[id]/edit
      /admin/developments
      /admin/developments/new
      /admin/developments/[id]/edit
      /admin/homeowners
      /admin/homeowners/new
      /admin/homeowners/[id]/edit

7. Clean Imports and Types
   - Remove unused imports
   - Resolve TypeScript edge errors
   - Ensure correct paths for schema and server actions

----------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES:
- Do NOT modify QR onboarding files.
- Do NOT introduce new libraries.
- Keep all code aligned with our monorepo structure.
- All data access must be via server-side supabase client only.
- Produce a clean, production-ready Developer Portal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
After you complete all tasks:
- Restart both portals
- Confirm successful compilation
- Summarise exactly what was modified
- Provide a list of any follow-up items needed before Phase 11

Begin now.
