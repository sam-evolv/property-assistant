## OBJECTIVE
Perfect the entire application’s UI/UX by:
1. Enabling a fully functional, system-aware dark/light mode toggle that recolors *every* element dynamically.
2. Correcting layout behavior so the Chat and Map pages are **completely static single-screen views** (no scrollbars, no overlap).
3. Refining and expanding the Map filters (shops, schools, healthcare, transport, etc.) into a comprehensive, professional category system.
4. Polishing the entire layout so every page feels like a first-party native app — fluid, balanced, and responsive.

## TASKS

### 1. ✅ GLOBAL DARK/LIGHT MODE PARITY

- Implement full dynamic theming using Tailwind’s dark mode.  
  Confirm `darkMode: "class"` in `tailwind.config.ts`.

- The theme toggle must:
  - Update `<html>` class (`dark` / remove `dark`) instantly.
  - Persist preference in `localStorage`.
  - Default to user system setting (`prefers-color-scheme`).

- All elements adapt dynamically:
  | Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
  |----------|-------------|-----------|
  | Background | `bg-white` | `bg-neutral-950` |
  | Text | `text-gray-900` | `text-gray-100` |
  | Cards | `bg-gray-50` | `bg-neutral-900` |
  | Borders | `border-gray-200` | `border-neutral-800` |
  | Dock | `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-xl` | `bg-neutral-950/80 backdrop-blur-xl` |
  | Input bar | `bg-gray-50 border-gray-200` | `bg-neutral-900 border-neutral-800` |
  | Buttons | `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700` | `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600` |

- Test transitions in both modes across:
  - Chat
  - Map
  - Noticeboard
  - Documents

### 2. ✅ CHAT LAYOUT (STATIC FULL-SCREEN EXPERIENCE)

- The Chat interface should mimic ChatGPT exactly:
  - Full viewport lock:  
    ```tsx
    <main className="h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center overflow-hidden">
    ```
  - Top bar (logo + toggles) fixed.
  - Message area fixed height with subtle gradient top/bottom (`overflow-y-auto` only inside chat container).
  - Input bar fixed above bottom dock:
    ```tsx
    <div className="w-full max-w-2xl flex items-center bg-gray-50 dark:bg-neutral-900 border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-800 rounded-full shadow-sm px-4 py-3 fixed bottom-[5rem] left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2">
    ```
  - The white overlap issue (input under dock) must be eliminated by reserving bottom padding (`pb-[6rem]` in chat container).
  - Remove page scroll — only internal message area scrolls.
  - Center initial empty state perfectly:
    ```
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500">
      <p>Ask anything about your home or community…</p>
    </div>
    ```

### 3. ✅ MAP PAGE (STATIC VIEWPORT + REFINED FILTERS)

- Map must occupy the visible viewport without requiring scrollbars.
  - Wrap map in full-height container:
    ```tsx
    <main className="h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-between overflow-hidden">
    ```
  - Set map container:
    ```tsx
    <div id="map" className="w-[92%] h-[75%] rounded-2xl shadow-2xl overflow-hidden"></div>
    ```
  - Move category filter buttons to a responsive top bar that adapts to viewport width.

- **Expand category buttons**:
  Replace the current limited set (`All, Shops, Schools, Healthcare, Transport`) with the following:

All | Shops | Schools | Healthcare | Transport | Food & Drink | Gyms & Fitness | Parks | Services | Childcare | Public Offices

bash
Copy code

Use `flex-wrap` with scrollable overflow (`overflow-x-auto`) for mobile.

Example:
```tsx
<div className="flex gap-2 overflow-x-auto px-4 py-3 w-full justify-center scrollbar-hide">
  {["All","Shops","Schools","Healthcare","Transport","Food & Drink","Gyms & Fitness","Parks","Services","Childcare","Public Offices"].map(item => (
    <button key={item}
      className="px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full backdrop-blur-md bg-white/70 dark:bg-neutral-800/60 text-sm text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition whitespace-nowrap">
      {item}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
Add subtle active state (bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900/40 text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300).

Ensure the map zooms and centers dynamically on filter selection (POI category queries update markers).

4. ✅ GENERAL POLISH
Ensure equal spacing and visual balance across all pages:

Dock icons evenly distributed (justify-around).

Remove any inconsistent vertical gaps.

Center all content inside max-w-3xl mx-auto.

Use consistent text-base + text-sm font scale system.

Adjust hover/press states:

All buttons and icons use transition-all duration-200.

Add subtle scale on hover for touch feel (hover:scale-[1.03]).

Ensure consistent z-index layering:
Top bar (z-50), map overlays (z-40), dock (z-30), content (z-20).

5. ✅ QUALITY & TESTING
Test all pages in:

Desktop view

iPhone 14 viewport

iPad viewport

Confirm no scrollbar visible anywhere except internal message scroll in chat.

Toggle between light/dark mode — ensure background, cards, icons, map overlays all adapt.

Check map category responsiveness.

Confirm no overlap between chatbox and dock at any resolution.
