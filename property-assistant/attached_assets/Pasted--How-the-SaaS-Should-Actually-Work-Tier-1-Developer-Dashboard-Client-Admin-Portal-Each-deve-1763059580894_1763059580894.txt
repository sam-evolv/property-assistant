✔️ How the SaaS Should Actually Work
🔵 Tier 1 – Developer Dashboard (Client Admin Portal)
Each developer logs into:
YOURDOMAIN.com/developer
They see:


Their developments


Their units


Their notices


A “Knowledge Base” upload panel


A “Documents” upload panel


A “Train the AI” button


Upload panel must support:


CSVs


PDFs (handover docs)


Word docs


Images (plans, fire certs)


FAQs


Snag lists


Maintenance procedures


O&M manuals


Local POIs


Waste rules


Rent/buy contract info
…all per development.


All of this is multi-tenant.
Next week, you don’t hardcode Seaview — you upload Seaview like a client.

✔️ Tier 2 – Backend Training Pipeline (Multi-tenant)
When a developer uploads files, the backend should:


Detect file type
🟦 CSV
🟩 PDF
🟧 DOCX
🟨 Image (OCR)


Extract text


Chunk text
~400–700 tokens


Embed with OpenAI
Write vector to:


doc_chunks
  - id
  - tenantId
  - content
  - embedding
  - sourceType
  - sourceId
  - createdAt



Store structured data
For units, POIs, contacts, notices.


Exactly what ChatGPT RAG expects.

✔️ Tier 3 – Resident Chat
When a resident asks:

“What date is bin collection?”

The system:


Looks up tenantId


Runs vector search on that tenant’s content


Retrieves only Seaview’s—or Glenveagh’s, or Cairn’s—context


Sends context to GPT


GPT answers with:


Accuracy


References


Professional tone




No cross-contamination between schemes.

✔️ Designing this as a true SaaS (the right future-proof way)
Your instinct is correct:

Training should not be inside Replit.

Replit builds the engine.
Clients (developers) use the portal to feed it data.
This sets you up to onboard dozens of developers:


Cairn Homes


Glenveagh


Longview Estates


Durkan


OMCs


Small landlords


Management companies


Each one uploads their own documents → AI assistant becomes trained per development.

🚀 What you need next (and I will generate):
A. A multi-tenant training UI inside Developer Dashboard


“Upload files” panel


“Add FAQs” panel


“Add notices” panel


“Train AI” button (progress indicator)


B. Backend API endpoints


POST /api/train/upload


POST /api/train/embed


POST /api/train/pipeline


GET /api/train/status


C. Automatic ingestion pipeline
Already started — now we expand it for multi-scheme support.
D. A Replit Agent prompt that builds all of this

👉 Before I generate the massive Agent prompt:
I need ONE clarifying answer:
Do you want this training system to support:
Option 1: File uploads only
(CSV, PDF, DOCX, images)
Option 2: Full CMS-style input
(Developers can manually add/edit FAQs, POIs, notices, etc.)
Option 3: Both (recommended for enterprise SaaS)
Upload files + manually edit content

Reply with 1, 2, or 3. I’ll then produce the full production-grade Replit Agent setup.
