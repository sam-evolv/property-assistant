This is the only source of truth for the Planner. Follow it literally and completely.
Do NOT invent new design decisions. Do NOT deviate from the specifications.
All work must restore the portal to the exact design shown in Sam’s screenshots AND improve quality.

📌 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Restore and rebuild the entire Purchaser Portal UX/UI so that it matches the design and structure of the 4 high-quality reference screenshots (MVP screenshots), but using OpenHouse AI's white-gold-black theme instead of blue.

The Purchaser Portal was previously correct but has been corrupted by recent changes.
Your job is to reset the entire Purchaser Portal ONLY (chat, maps, noticeboard, documents) back to Sam’s original design shown in the 8 screenshots, then upgrade it with the new quality requirements.

No changes should be made to:

Super Admin Portal

Developer Portal

Database schema

Authentication / impersonation logic

Only the Purchaser Portal UI, UX, and data wiring must be rebuilt.

🟡 GLOBAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1. Theme

Use the OpenHouse AI brand:

White background

Gold primary accents (#D4A017 type shade)

Clean black typography

Light-gray subtle dividers

Premium UI similar to ChatGPT/Gemini

Remove ALL blue styling.
Remove ALL blue buttons.
Remove ALL blue icons.

2. Mobile-First Layout

The design must fit entirely on an iPhone screen without scrolling on first load:

Logo

Welcome text

Four suggestion pills

Input bar
must be visible without scrolling.

3. Top Bar

The top bar must contain ONLY:

Top-left: Small development logo (uploaded by developer)

Top-right: Language selector + dark/light mode toggle

Remove:

Address bars

Unit metadata bars

Breadcrumbs

Counters

Headers like “Longview Park”

Any unnecessary chrome

🧩 MODULE-BY-MODULE SPECIFICATION

Follow these literally.

SECTION 1 — CHAT TAB
1.1 Restore exact MVP layout (per screenshots)

Must include:

Center circular developer logo

Bold headline:
“Ask anything about your home or community”

Subtext (smaller, cleaner, darker text)

Four small suggestion pills
(These must be smaller and higher quality than current ones.)

1.2 Input bar

Compact height

Clear black placeholder text (no faint gray)

Microphone button must work

Ask button aligned and compact

1.3 No scrolling needed on first load

Everything must fit on screen.

1.4 Chat messages

When chatting:

Use white/gold/black

No blue bubbles

No variations in theme

Must look premium and consistent

1.5 Logo upload

Developer portal must allow the developer to upload a logo.
This logo must appear:

In the top-left corner

In the center of the chat home screen

SECTION 2 — MAP TAB
2.1 Remove incorrect top bar

Remove:

Address bar

Unit info

Google/Apple Maps buttons

2.2 Map

Restore Google Maps API

Center the map on the development’s actual latitude/longitude

Fix API key usage

Ensure map always loads correctly

2.3 Filter bar

Restore the MVP filter bar design:

Horizontal scroll pill filters

Small icons

Categories:
Banking, Bars, Cafés, DIY, Dog Parks, Schools, EV Charging, Fuel, Groceries, Restaurants, Gyms, etc.

Use gold/gray styling

Clicking a filter updates map markers

SECTION 3 — NOTICEBOARD TAB
3.1 Remove incorrect title bar

Replace entire top header with:

Top-left logo

Top-right language toggle + dark/light mode

3.2 Proper name

Rename to:

No counters

No blue

SECTION 4 — DOCUMENTS TAB
4.1 Fix document fetching

The current implementation is broken.
Implement the correct logic:

Document logic rules (critical):

All documents WITHOUT a unit-type tag are global documents → appear for every house.

Any document whose filename or metadata contains a house type (BD01, BD02, BS01, BS02, AT01, etc.):

Only show these to units with the same house type.

4.2 Restore MVP grid layout

Category grid

Small icons

Document counts

Gold/white/black theme

Search bar

Pill filters

4.3 Remove address bar

Do NOT show the user their address. They know it.

Developer dashboard

Impersonation logic

Backend authentication

Database schema

RAG embeddings

Supabase tables

OpenAI logic

Routing for super admin

Only the Purchaser Portal UX/UI and data wiring.

SECTION 7 — OUTPUT FORMAT FOR PLANNER

Respond with:

A complete list of required code changes

Files to modify

Components to rebuild

Ensure the plan is modular, sequential, and safe

No dependencies on previous broken code

Ensure backward compatibility with existing APIs

Prioritise UI rebuild → then data wiring → then functional fixes

SECTION 8 — QUALITY BAR

Design must feel like ChatGPT/Gemini quality:

Smooth spacing

Perfect typography

Clean alignment

High-end polish

Zero clutter

This is a premium property-tech product used by large developers.
The UX must match that standard.
