PHASE 16 OBJECTIVES
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Create Pilot Estate: Longview Park
   • Insert a new tenant: “Longview Estates”
   • Insert a new development: “Longview Park”
     – Include location (lat/lng)
     – Development metadata
   • Insert house types (A, B, C, etc.) based on the seed templates
   • Insert N houses (use a realistic sample set):
     – house_id
     – MRPN / lot numbers
     – purchaser_name = null (not required)
     – house_type
     – QR_uid (uuid4)

2. Generate QR Codes for Each House
   • Create a script: scripts/generate-qrs.ts
   • For each house:
       – Read QR_uid
       – Generate URL: https://app.openhouseai.ie/onboarding?uid=XXXX
       – Render QR as PNG
       – Save under /attached_assets/qrs/house_<id>.png
   • Produce a summary JSON with:
       – house_id
       – QR_uid
       – onboarding_url
       – file_path

3. Seed Documents for Longview Park
   • Upload 5–10 sample PDFs to Supabase storage:
       – House manual
       – Warranty pack
       – BER certificate
       – Appliance manuals
   • Auto-chunk and embed them using existing embedding pipeline
   • Link documents to the Longview Park development

4. Validate Full Homeowner Flow (Production Simulation)
   • Using production build:
       – Scan (open) onboarding URL

       – Verify noticeboard is empty but functional

5. Create Developer Staff Accounts

   • Ensure they can:
       – Log in to Developer Portal
       – Upload new documents
       – Moderate noticeboard
       – Preview theme changes
