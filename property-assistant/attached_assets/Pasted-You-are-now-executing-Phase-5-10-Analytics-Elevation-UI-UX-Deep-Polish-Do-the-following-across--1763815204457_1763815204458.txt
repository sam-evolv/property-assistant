You are now executing Phase 5.10 — Analytics Elevation & UI/UX Deep Polish.
Do the following across the developer dashboard, enterprise dashboard, and global analytics stack:

1. Add All Missing Intelligence Components

Implement the full suite of analytics widgets originally planned:

A) RAG / AI Performance

Top RAG misses (documents that fail retrieval)

Embedding drift graph

Retrieval latency distribution

“Problematic Documents” list
(sorted by fetch failures or no-match scores)

B) User Intelligence

Top homeowner questions (30 days)

Repeated questions (indicating missing content)

“Confusion Points” heatmap

Homeowner engagement funnel:

QR Scan → First Visit → Chat Use → Return Visit

C) Content & Document Intelligence

Document health scoring (unused, under-used, outdated)

Missing document predictions (AI-based)

“Knowledge Gaps by House Type”

Document freshness timeline (upload age distribution)

D) Operational Metrics

Monthly active homeowners

Developer support load reduction (AI-estimated)

Cost-to-serve analytics (OpenAI cost modeling)

Chat deflection rate (% of questions answered without staff)

2. Add 8 New Premium UI Components

All visually aligned to the OpenHouseAI black/white/gold design:

MetricPulseCard (animated KPI tile)

TrendStream (real-time sparkline strip)

InsightBanner (AI-generated written insight)

HealthGauge (donut gauge for document/RAG health)

PersonaSplitChart (engagement split by persona)

HeatMatrix (for question categories)

ContentLifecycleChart (document upload → use → decay)

CostTrajectory (OpenAI cost modelling chart)

3. Expand the Navigation

Add new left-nav + tab navigation that matches a premium SaaS product:

Developer Portal
Dashboard
Developments
Analytics
  • Overview
  • Trends
  • Homeowners
  • Documents
  • RAG Performance
  • Knowledge Gaps
  • Cost Intelligence
Tools
Settings
Theme Editor

Enterprise Dashboard (Super Admin)
Global Analytics
Developers
  • Performance Leaderboard
  • Risk Flags
  • Knowledge Holes
System Health
AI Assistant Training
Billing & Costs

4. Visual Consistency Pass

Apply a global polish pass:

Standardise all padding, spacing, and corner radii

Replace all inconsistent icons with a unified icon set

Ensure all metric cards use the same typography scale

Replace leftover placeholders with real skeleton loaders

Add tasteful micro-animations (fade, slide-in, counters, hover)

5. Improve Charting Quality

For all charts:

Use smooth bezier curves where appropriate

Increase hitbox sizes for tooltips (mobile-friendly)

Add hover-based value markers

Add multi-series support for upcoming phases

Improve axis formatting (remove clutter, add thousand separators)

Dark-mode gold theme by default

6. Improve Analytics API (analytics-v2)

Expand all existing 7 endpoints + add 6 new ones:

New API routes:
/api/analytics-v2/top-questions
/api/analytics-v2/repeated-questions
/api/analytics-v2/rag-latency
/api/analytics-v2/document-health
/api/analytics-v2/cost-model
/api/analytics-v2/user-funnel


All must:

Use assertEnterpriseUser + enforceTenantScope

Return structured JSON

Be typed (TypeScript interfaces)

Include error boundaries

7. Add AI-Generated Insights

Every analytics tab gets a top banner:

“Insight generated automatically based on the last 30 days of activity.”

Implement:

generateInsightFor(sectionName, metrics)

Call OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini or 4.1 (whichever you used previously)

Cache results for 24h

8. Layout Overhaul

Fix what you complained about:

Remove clutter

Increase white/black contrast separation

Make all charts equal height

Use a professional 4-column grid at desktop widths

Improve mobile responsiveness dramatically

Add section headers with descriptions

9. Ensure All Old Analytics are Removed

System must contain:

No legacy charts

No dead imports

No unused code

No previous analytics versions

10. Final Output Requirements

When complete, provide:

A) Full code changes

(Agent should generate everything.)

B) A “Phase 5.10 COMPLETION REPORT” including:

New components added

API routes generated

UI changes

Bugs fixed

Outstanding opportunities for Phase 5.11

Before vs. after comparison

C) Update replit.md with:
