Reuse this component for:
	•	Public transport
	•	Waste collection
	•	Parking rules
	•	Local area

	5.	Chat Input Bar
Transform the existing text input + mic + send into a floating, high-end pill:

	•	Container:
	•	mt-7
	•	Input wrapper:
	•	flex items-center rounded-full border border-slate-200 bg-slate-50/80 px-3 py-1 shadow-[0_8px_24px_rgba(15,23,42,0.12)] focus-within:border-amber-400 focus-within:bg-white focus-within:shadow-[0_12px_30px_rgba(15,23,42,0.16)] transition-all
	•	Input field:
	•	flex-1 border-none bg-transparent px-2 py-2 text-[14px] text-slate-900 placeholder:text-slate-400 focus:outline-none
	•	Mic button:
	•	mr-1 flex h-8 w-8 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-white/80 text-slate-500 shadow-sm hover:bg-slate-100 transition
	•	Send button:
	•	flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-400 to-amber-500 text-white shadow-[0_8px_20px_rgba(245,158,11,0.7)] hover:brightness-110 active:translate-y-0.5 active:shadow-[0_4px_12px_rgba(245,158,11,0.7)] transition-all

Under the pill, add a very small caption (if not present already) using:
	•	mt-2 text-center text-[11px] text-slate-400

	6.	Motion & Micro-Interactions
Across all interactive elements:

	•	Add transitions:
	•	transition-all duration-200 ease-out
	•	Use subtle scale/translate on hover for buttons:
	•	Example: hover:-translate-y-0.5
	•	Shadows:
	•	Lighter shadow at rest, stronger shadow + slight lift on hover.
	•	Maintain consistent border radius:
	•	rounded-3xl for main card containers.
	•	rounded-full for pills and circular buttons.

	7.	Implementation GUIDELINES

	•	Do NOT alter any API calls, hooks, data fetching, or component logic.
	•	Do NOT rename components, props, or exports.
	•	Do NOT remove any existing content or change copy.
	•	You MAY:
	•	Refactor JSX markup slightly to wrap elements in new containers where necessary for layout.
	•	Introduce small presentational components for reusability (e.g. TopicPill) as long as props stay simple and local to the UI.
	•	Keep everything mobile-first. The design should look excellent on the viewport shown in the screenshot. If there are desktop styles, make sure they scale gracefully, but mobile is the primary reference.

TASKS
	1.	Identify the React component(s) that render:
	•	The header bar, hero text, topic buttons, and bottom input.
	2.	Upgrade their JSX and classNames according to the spec above.
	3.	Preserve all behaviour and text verbatim.
	4.	Run the app and visually verify on the default route that:
	•	The background gradient, central card, and header blur are applied.
	•	The four topic buttons are pill-shaped, elevated, and animated.
	•	The chat input pill is visually prominent and interactive.
	5.	Clean up any unused styles or conflicting classes to avoid visual glitches.

OUTPUT
Implement the changes directly in the project files. When you are finished, summarise:
	•	Which files you updated
	•	What components you changed
	•	Any minor deviations you had to make from the spec to fit the existing codebase
