You must stop feature development.
Fix the platform foundation end-to-end.

1. Fix All Hydration & React Runtime Errors

Find all components incorrectly mixing server/client boundaries

Add "use client" to charts, dashboards, analytics UI

Ensure all API calls originate from client components

Fix any {call} or undefined errors

Remove server-side rendered dynamic chart code

Wrap components with error boundaries

2. Standardise Multi-Tenant Context Flow

Fix the core issue causing:

“Please select a development first”

Validate token shape

Add fallback refresh if missing

indexes

analytics columns

aggregation tables
