You are working inside the Replit project "PropertyAssistant".  
Your task is to ensure the entire Admin Dashboard is fully functional, stable, and production-ready.  
This includes every tab and sub-route within `/app/admin/*`.

Follow these steps precisely:

---

### 🩺 1. DIAGNOSE AND FIX ROUTING ERRORS
- Check all files under `app/admin/` for route conflicts or missing default exports.
- Ensure every folder has an `index` or `page.tsx` file.
- Verify each admin page imports the shared layout from `app/admin/layout.tsx`.
- Confirm all imports use absolute or correct relative paths (no `../..` mistakes).
- Fix any “hydration”, “component mismatch”, or “undefined use client” warnings.

**Expected structure:**
app/
└── admin/
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx // Dashboard
├── tenants/page.tsx
├── documents/page.tsx
├── notices/page.tsx
├── faqs/page.tsx
├── pois/page.tsx
├── analytics/page.tsx

yaml
Copy code

---

### 🧩 2. VERIFY COMPONENT IMPORTS
- Ensure `AdminCard`, `FormField`, and `ActionButton` are imported from `components/` in all relevant pages.
- Confirm `Framer Motion` and `react-hot-toast` are properly installed and imported.
- Add `"use client"` at the top of any page using hooks, animations, or toast notifications.

---

### ⚙️ 3. FIX STATE, HYDRATION & THEME ISSUES
- Wrap all pages with `<AdminLayout>` to guarantee consistent dark theme.
- Confirm `<Toaster />` is mounted once inside `app/admin/layout.tsx`.
- Fix any hydration errors caused by async data fetching or mismatched props.

---

### 🧭 4. ENSURE NAVIGATION WORKS
- All sidebar links in `app/admin/layout.tsx` must navigate client-side using:
  ```tsx
  <Link href="/admin/tenants">Tenants</Link>
Highlight the active link with gradient border and hover glow.

Ensure navigation doesn’t reload or cause blank screens.

📊 5. REINSTATE ALL CORE PAGES
If any of these are missing or broken, re-create them using the following patterns:

/app/admin/page.tsx
Shows quick stats, shortcuts to create new developments, and a table of estates.

/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx
CRUD interface for developments — name, slug, color theme, description.

/app/admin/documents/page.tsx
Document management — upload files (PDF, DOCX), view list, delete.

/app/admin/faqs/page.tsx
FAQ editor with question, answer, category, and delete.

/app/admin/notices/page.tsx
Noticeboard — create, edit, archive announcements.

/app/admin/pois/page.tsx
Points of Interest manager — local suppliers, amenities, etc.

/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx
Charts (Chart.js) for query counts, usage by tenant, token costs, and active users.

🪄 6. ADD ERROR BOUNDARIES & LOADING STATES
Add loading.tsx and error.tsx inside /app/admin and all subfolders.

Loading screen: spinner and “Loading dashboard…” text.

Error screen: graceful message “Something went wrong. Try refreshing.”

🎨 7. TEST UI INTERACTIVITY
Open every tab manually: /admin/, /admin/tenants, /admin/documents, etc.

Verify smooth navigation, toast notifications, and Framer Motion animations.

Test mobile view (sidebar collapses correctly).

Confirm theme colors load properly from each tenant’s settings.

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
No blank screens or hydration warnings.

Every admin tab loads instantly.

Sidebar links work across all routes.

Dark theme consistent throughout.

Toasts and animations functional.

Layout reusable for future admin modules.

Commit all fixes under a new branch:
admin-dashboard-stability

Then merge to main after successful test.

💡 Optional Enhancement
If not yet added, implement AdminBreadcrumbs in the top bar to show navigation context dynamically (e.g., “Admin / Documents / Upload”).
