# OpenHouse AI - Developer Portal

Developer-facing dashboard for managing property developments.

## Overview

The Developer Portal will allow property developers to:
- Manage their property developments
- Configure AI assistants for each development
- Upload and manage property documents
- Monitor resident interactions
- View analytics and insights

## Development

```bash
# From the developer-portal directory
npm run dev

# From the root directory
npm run dev:developer
```

The app runs on http://localhost:3001 by default.

## Status

This is currently a placeholder app created as part of the monorepo restructuring.
Developer-specific routes will be migrated here from `apps/tenant-portal` in future phases.
