Objective: Implement incremental improvements to the developer dashboard that enhance clarity and drive engagement, while preserving existing functionality and styling.

Scope of Work (highest ROI tasks)

Add period comparisons to summary cards

For Onboarding Rate, Engagement Rate and Must‑Read Compliance, compute the same metric for the previous 30‑day period (or another reasonable default). Display the difference as a small badge with a +/– value, e.g. “+2 pp vs previous period”.

Remove the current ambiguous “+100 %” badge.

Introduce call‑to‑action links for low engagement/compliance

Under the Engagement Rate and Must‑Read Compliance cards, add a small text link like “Send reminder to inactive homeowners” or “View units without acknowledgement”.

Clicking the link should navigate to the existing homeowners list with a filter applied (e.g. ?active=false or ?compliance=false). Use internal routing; do not add new pages.

Clean up chart labels

In the “What Homeowners Ask About” bar chart, shorten or wrap long labels gracefully to avoid line breaks in the middle of words (“Waste Collection” instead of “Waste / Collection”; “Document Link Request” on one line if space permits).

Ensure the chart is responsive; use ellipses with a tooltip on hover if the label exceeds the available width.

Retain the existing color palette and bar spacing.

Expose unit counts in the “Your Developments” list

Augment each development entry with a small badge or line of text indicating the total number of units and the number of active units (e.g. “129 units / 28 active”).

Use a muted text color to avoid overpowering the existing “Active” badge.

Pull this data from the same source used for the onboarding metrics; no new API calls should be required.

Add simple hover tooltips to Chat Activity graph

Implement tooltips that display the exact date and number of chat interactions when hovering over points on the “Chat Activity” line chart.

Keep the interaction lightweight—tooltips should fade in/out and not alter the graph layout.

Implementation Notes

Use existing CSS classes and components wherever possible to maintain consistent styling.

Any new text strings should be internationalization‑ready (use existing i18n methods if present).

Do not remove or rename current components, APIs, or routes; simply extend them.

Test each change in isolation on a development branch and verify that the dashboard continues to load without console errors.

By focusing on these specific enhancements, you will deliver meaningful value—better insight into trends, actionable paths for improving engagement/compliance, clearer charts and more informative development listings—without destabilising the existing application.
