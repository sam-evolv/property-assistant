You are working in the **PropertyAssistant monorepo**, specifically the purchaser chat UI.

Your task is to FIX ONE THING ONLY.

---

## GOAL

Make the **vertical gap between the chat input box and the bottom navigation toolbar** be:

* **Exactly the same at all times**
* **Identical to the gap shown in the reference “correct” screenshot**
* **Unaffected by keyboard open/close**
* **Unaffected by focus state**
* **Unaffected by chat vs home screen**
* **Unaffected by message count**

This gap must be **static, fixed, and visually constant**.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. ❌ Do NOT dynamically calculate height based on:

   * viewport height
   * keyboard presence
   * safe-area insets
   * visualViewport
   * focus state
   * messages.length
   * showHome
   * any conditional logic

2. ❌ Do NOT adjust padding, margin, or spacing conditionally.

3. ❌ Do NOT introduce JavaScript layout math.

4. ❌ Do NOT touch any other part of the UI.

5. ❌ Do NOT “improve”, “optimize”, or “refactor”.

---

## WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

Use **pure CSS layout rules** so that:

* The bottom toolbar is position: fixed
* The chat input container is position: fixed
* The chat input container sits **directly above the toolbar**
* The distance between them is a **hard-coded constant**
* This spacing NEVER changes

The keyboard opening MUST NOT introduce additional space.
The keyboard closing MUST NOT remove space.
The layout MUST NOT jump.

---

## EXPECTED STRUCTURE (HIGH LEVEL)

BottomToolbar
position: fixed
bottom: 0

ChatInputContainer
position: fixed
bottom: (toolbar height + fixed gap)

MessagesContainer
padding-bottom: (toolbar height + fixed gap + input height)

---

## DELIVERABLE

1. Identify the ONE component responsible for:

   * chat input
   * bottom spacing

2. Remove ALL dynamic spacing logic.

3. Apply a **single, fixed CSS spacing rule**.

4. Verify manually:

   * fresh load
   * with messages
   * without messages
   * keyboard open
   * keyboard closed

If the gap visually changes in ANY state, the task has FAILED.

---

## STOP CONDITION

When the chat always looks like the “correct” screenshot
and NEVER like the “incorrect” one,
the task is complete.
