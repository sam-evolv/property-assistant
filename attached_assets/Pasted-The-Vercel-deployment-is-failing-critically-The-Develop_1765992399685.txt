The Vercel deployment is failing critically: The Developer Dashboard, Super Admin Dashboard, and Chat Assistant Documents are all empty or broken.
We suspect the "Data Sync" to Drizzle failed. We need to switch to a "Direct Read" strategy immediately.

Please execute these 4 Critical Fixes:

### 1. FIX DASHBOARDS (Bypass Drizzle, Read Supabase)
- **The Issue:** The Developer and Admin dashboards are querying the local Drizzle DB (which is empty/broken).
- **The Fix:** Modify the data fetching functions for these dashboards (e.g., in `apps/unified-portal/lib/api/units.ts` or `dashboard/page.tsx`).
- **Action:** Instead of using `db.select().from(units)...`, switch them to use `supabase.from('units').select('*')`.
- **Crucial:** Ensure it filters by the *correct* Project ID (try both `6d37...` and `e0833...` or remove the filter temporarily) to ensure data appears.

### 2. FIX CHAT DOCS (Fix RLS & Vector Search)
- **The Issue:** The Chat Assistant sees "0 documents". This is likely a Row Level Security (RLS) block or a missing Vector Store connection.
- **The Fix:**
  - Open `apps/unified-portal/app/api/documents/route.ts`.
  - Switch the Supabase client initialization to use the `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (admin access) instead of the standard client. This bypasses RLS and forces the server to see ALL documents.
  - **Constraint:** `const supabase = createClient(..., process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)`.

### 3. UNBLOCK ADMIN ROUTES (Middleware)
- **The Issue:** The Super Admin dashboard is likely unreachable or redirects to home.
- **The Fix:** Open `middleware.ts`. Add `/admin` and `/developer` to the whitelist of routes that do NOT require standard purchaser authentication.

### 4. DEBUG MODE (Print the Error)
- **The Fix:** In `apps/unified-portal/app/api/chat/route.ts` and `dashboard/page.tsx`, add a `console.log("Fetching from Project ID:", projectId)` so we can see in the Vercel logs exactly which ID is failing.

**Goal:** Dashboards must populate with live data from Supabase, and the Chat Documents tab must list all files by using Admin privileges.
