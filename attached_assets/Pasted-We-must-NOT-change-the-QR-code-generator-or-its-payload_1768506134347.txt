We must NOT change the QR code generator or its payloads. All QR codes already resolve to:
[https://portal.openhouseai.ie/homes/{HOME_UUID}](https://portal.openhouseai.ie/homes/{HOME_UUID})
Example:
[https://portal.openhouseai.ie/homes/1144ead6-8425-4c20-bf51-d35a75fae3c4](https://portal.openhouseai.ie/homes/1144ead6-8425-4c20-bf51-d35a75fae3c4)

Required behaviour when this URL is opened from a QR scan:

1. If user is on iPhone (iOS Safari / in-app browser):

   * Do NOT open the web portal.
   * Show a dedicated landing/interstitial page prompting installation of the iOS app.
   * Page must have:

     * Primary CTA: “Install OpenHouse AI” -> App Store link for the app
     * Clear instruction: “After installing, open the app and scan this QR code to access your home.”
     * Optional secondary CTA: “Open App” (only useful if installed) that deep-links to the app’s scanner screen.
       Use a custom URL scheme like: openhouseai://scan
       (If you prefer, also support openhouseai://scan?home={uuid}, but DO NOT rely on it; the core flow is: install -> scan in-app.)
   * Avoid auto-redirect loops; do not try to force open the app automatically.

2. If user is NOT on iPhone (Android/Desktop/etc.):

   * Continue current behaviour: open the web portal for that home UUID.
   * If there is an existing web route for the UUID, redirect there; otherwise render the existing portal page.

Where to implement:

* Implement logic at the web layer that handles /homes/{uuid}.
* If this is a Next.js app, create/modify route handler for /homes/[uuid]:

  * On server: read user-agent and decide:

    * iOS -> return rendered Interstitial component
    * non-iOS -> redirect to the normal portal view (existing behaviour)
  * Add cache-control appropriately (ideally no-store) to avoid stale device detection.

Also:

* Add “Download QR” / “Portal URL” stays unchanged in admin UI.
* Ensure the existing “Open Portal” button still opens the web portal view for desktop/non-iPhone.

iOS App requirement (small change):

* Add support for custom URL scheme openhouseai://scan that navigates user directly to the in-app QR scanner screen.
* This is optional but recommended for installed users.

Deliverables:

* Interstitial page built with the site’s existing styling.
* Verified device routing works:

  * iPhone -> interstitial with App Store CTA
  * Android -> web portal
  * Desktop -> web portal
