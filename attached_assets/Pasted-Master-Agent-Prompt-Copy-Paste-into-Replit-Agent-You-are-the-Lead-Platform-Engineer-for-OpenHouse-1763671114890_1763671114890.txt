Master Agent Prompt (Copy/Paste into Replit Agent)

You are the Lead Platform Engineer for OpenHouse AI.
Phase 13 expands the Developer Portal and Super-Admin Portal to provide advanced, enterprise-grade productivity tools for developers and support teams.

Assume Phases 1–12 are functioning and stable:

Multi-tenant backend

Full analytics engine

UI/UX polish

RBAC & security hardening

Mapping refinements

Developer portal feature expansion

Production hardening

Phase 12: Real-world usage data loop

Phase 13 builds tooling that materially increases the value of the platform for developers, support teams, and property administrators.

PHASE 13 — ENTERPRISE DEVELOPER TOOLS EXPANSION
Complete all tasks safely, incrementally, and with full backwards compatibility. Do not break current portals.
13.1 — Bulk Operations Engine (Developments, Houses, Docs)

Build a new subsystem allowing developers to perform safe batch operations:

A) Bulk House Import

CSV upload (house list, metadata, purchaser names, QR UIDs)

Pre-validation step

Dry-run preview

Error reporting

Safe migration tool for large estates (100–500 units)

B) Bulk Document Assignment

Multi-select PDF assignment to multiple house types

Auto-retagging

Batch embedding jobs

Background worker pipeline integration (reuse Phase 5 async engine)

C) Bulk Purchaser Updates

Sale status

New owners

Phase turnover

Keys-handover logging

Automatic analytics updates

13.2 — Embedded Release Notes & System Changelog

Inside each developer’s portal:

Add “Release Notes” panel

Populate from releasenotes table

Developer sees platform updates, new features, bug fixes

Per-tenant visibility rules

Markdown support

Super-admin UI to create entries

13.3 — Developer Support Ticketing (Internal Light Version)

Introduce internal support tooling:

Table: support_tickets

Fields: development_id, tenant_id, category, severity, message, attachments (PDF/image), status, timestamps

Simple UI: list, filter, reply

Automatic linking to the developer’s authenticated user

Notifications (app-level only, no email yet)

Analytics widget: open tickets, age, status distribution

This is NOT a full ticket system. Keep it lightweight, internal, and scoped.

13.4 — PDF Quality Checker + Missing Documentation Detector

Enhance developer operations:

Detector runs:

Missing required PDFs per house type

Duplicated documents

Oversized PDFs

OCR-required documents

Expired warranties or certificates (via metadata rules)

UI component:

Red/amber/green status panel

Per-development dashboard summary

Exportable “missing docs” list

Integrates with analytics layer

13.5 — Interactive Data Explorer (Admin-Only)

Add an internal admin-only interface for real-time inspection:

Query viewer (read-only): houses, developments, tenants, docs, messages

Warning banners reminding of read-only mode

Pagination + filters

No write operations

This is essential for debugging production issues without DB access.

13.6 — Embedding Management Console

For the AI layer:

Show list of embedded documents

Sizes, chunk count

Last embed timestamp

“Re-embed document” button

“Purge embeddings” (admin-only)

Background worker integration

Real-time status indicator

Error reporting console

13.7 — Developer Experience (DX) Enhancements

Polish the entire developer portal experience:

Navigation & Layout

Add left-sidebar collapse

Improve section grouping categories

Breadcrumbs in all pages

Better loading skeletons

Empty states for all tables

Performance

Cache frequently-used metadata

Speed up document library

Optimize house type retrieval queries

Accessibility

Keyboard navigation

ARIA labels

High contrast mode toggle

13.8 — Super-Admin Power Tools

Build a new “Power Tools” panel for you:

Tenant impersonation mode (safe, logged, read-only)

Rapid development creation wizard

QR regeneration at scale

Orphaned entry detector (house types without docs, developments without houses)

Background job monitor (Phase 5 worker status page)

Live system metrics

“Slow query detector” integration

13.9 — Integrate All Phase 13 Tools Cleanly

All new features must be:

Fully RBAC safe

Fully multi-tenant safe

Non-breaking

Using existing UI pattern (shadcn, Tailwind, RSC)

Routed under correct portal paths

Documented in README_DEV.md

Added to analytics (usage metrics)

Phase 13 — Execution Instructions for the Agent

Follow this exact sequence:

Inspect current code

Create all new tables

Add migrations

Build backend APIs

Build frontend pages

Integrate with analytics

Add caching where needed

Add safety checks & RBAC

Run architect review

Restart workflows

Verify no regressions in all portals

Mark tasks as complete

All changes must be atomic and reversible.
Do NOT break any existing estate or portal.
