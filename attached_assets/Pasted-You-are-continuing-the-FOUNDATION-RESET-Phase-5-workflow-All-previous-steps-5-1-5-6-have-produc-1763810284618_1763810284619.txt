You are continuing the FOUNDATION RESET → Phase 5 workflow.
All previous steps (5.1–5.6) have produced charts, insight cards, tables, and routes.
Now assemble them into a premium, unified analytics dashboard.

PRIMARY GOALS

Implement a production-ready analytics page that includes:

1. FULL UI ASSEMBLY

Integrate all chart components created earlier:

MessageVolumeChart

ChatCostChart

HouseTypeDistributionChart

TopQuestionsChart

DocumentLatencyChart

AILoadDistributionChart

EmbeddingVolumeChart

KnowledgeGapHeatmap

Integrate all Insight Cards:

ActiveUsersCard

ResponseTimeCard

MostAccessedDocsCard

RAGCoverageCard

EngagementScoreCard

PeakUsageTimeCard

HighSupportLoadCard

ConversationLengthCard

DocumentGrowthCard

TopCategoryCard

Integrate PremiumDataTable for analytics tables:

Add filtering + search

Connect to appropriate data endpoints

2. PAGE LAYOUT

Create a best-in-class analytics experience with:

Hero Title: “Analytics & Insights”

Subtext: “Performance, engagement, coverage, and operational intelligence across all developments.”

Clean 2-column or 3-column responsive layout

Section dividers

Scroll location memory

Sticky top bar for switching between:

Overview

Trends

Knowledge Gaps

RAG Performance

Documents

Homeowners

Units

3. DATA PIPELINE BINDING

Connect UI → API routes from Phase 5.2–5.4:

/api/analytics/messages

/api/analytics/cost

/api/analytics/house-types

/api/analytics/top-questions

/api/analytics/rag/coverage

/api/analytics/rag/knowledge-gaps

/api/analytics/documents

/api/analytics/units

/api/analytics/homeowners

/api/analytics/system-load

Ensure:

Tenant isolation enforced on every call

Development scope applied if provided

Hydration contexts are respected (useSafeAuth, useSafeDevelopment)

Loading skeletons for every component

Error states never break layout

4. PREMIUM VISUAL DESIGN

Apply the global theme (black/white/gold) consistently:

Card surfaces

Borders

Typography hierarchy

Chart legends

Tooltip design

Axis & grid styling

Iconography (Lucide)

Enhance with:

Micro-animations

Smooth fade-in for charts

Hover states on all insight cards

Subtle shadows (never cheap-looking)

Polished spacing scale (8/12/16/24/32)

5. PERFORMANCE

Lazy-load all chart components

Use React.Suspense with fallbacks

Cache responses via SWR or internal caching client

Avoid blocking hydration

Defer non-critical analytics

6. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

Add unified top-level page:
apps/unified-portal/app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx

Reuse DashboardShell if available

Ensure consistency with developer and enterprise portals

No console errors allowed

Strict TypeScript across all components

7. DOCUMENTATION

Update:

replit.md

MONOREPO_STRUCTURE.md

Add a new file:
logs/PHASE_5.7_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
including:

Component map

Data route bindings

Performance notes

Remaining opportunities for polish

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

Perform the following steps in order:

Create/modify the unified analytics page.

Assemble all charts and insight cards into a premium layout.

Connect all components to their API routes.

Implement loading skeletons and fallback boundaries.

Normalize theme + spacing across analytics UI.

Add interactions + hover states + animations.

Run a full UI audit and ensure everything renders cleanly.

Update documentation.

Generate the completion report.

When finished, output:

“PHASE 5.7 COMPLETE — READY FOR ARCHITECT REVIEW”
