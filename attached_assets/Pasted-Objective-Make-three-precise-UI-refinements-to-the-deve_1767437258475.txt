Objective: Make three precise UI refinements to the developer sidebar to improve professionalism and clarity. Do not modify routing, permissions, analytics, or layout structure beyond what is explicitly requested.

1) Replace Text Header with OpenHouse Logo

Current state:

Sidebar header shows text:

“OH Developer”

“OpenHouse Platform”

Change required:

Replace the text header entirely with the OpenHouse logo image provided.

The logo should:

Be left-aligned within the sidebar header area

Maintain proper padding (visually balanced, not touching edges)

Scale responsively (max height ~32–36px on desktop)

Preserve dark-theme contrast (no background box unless already present)

Implementation notes:

Use the existing sidebar header container

Import the logo asset correctly (no broken paths)

Remove or comment out the old text nodes, do not hide with CSS

2) Fix Current Scheme Dropdown Text Contrast

Current state:

Dropdown options (e.g. “Rathard Park”, “Longview Park”, “All Schemes”) render as black text on a dark background, making them unreadable.

Change required:

Update dropdown menu styles so:

All scheme names render in white text

Hover and selected states remain clearly legible

No regression to other dropdowns elsewhere in the app

Implementation notes:

Target only the Current Scheme selector

Prefer scoped styles or component-level styling

Do not globally override dropdown styles

3) Footer Text Formatting Adjustment

Current state:

Sidebar footer shows:

“OpenHouse AI v1.0.0”

Change required:

Update text to:

“OpenHouse ai v1.0.0”

“OpenHouse” as one word

“ai” lowercase

Implementation notes:

This is a text-only change

No version logic changes required

Ensure consistency across sidebar renders

Constraints (Important)

❌ Do NOT touch:

Authentication

Role routing

API calls

Sidebar navigation structure

❌ Do NOT introduce new dependencies

✅ Keep changes minimal, explicit, and scoped

Completion Criteria

Sidebar header displays the OpenHouse logo cleanly

Current Scheme dropdown text is clearly readable (white on dark)

Footer reads exactly: OpenHouse ai v1.0.0

No console errors

No visual regressions elsewhere in the portal

Proceed carefully and implement only what is specified above.
