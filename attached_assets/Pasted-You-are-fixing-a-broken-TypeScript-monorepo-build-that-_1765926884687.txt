You are fixing a broken TypeScript monorepo build that MUST succeed on Vercel.

This is NOT a dependency issue. This is a broken export graph.

Your job is to make the build deterministic and stop future regressions.

---

## ROOT CAUSE (DO NOT IGNORE)

The file `packages/api/src/index.ts` exports modules that DO NOT EXIST.

Specifically:

* `export * from './documents'` is invalid
* The `documents` directory was deleted or partially removed
* Webpack fails correctly with:
  "Module not found: Can't resolve './documents'"

This must be fixed at the SOURCE, not worked around.

---

## REQUIRED ACTIONS (IN ORDER)

### 1. Audit exports

Scan `packages/api/src/index.ts`.

For **every export**:

* Verify the file or folder exists
* Verify it has a resolvable `.ts` file or `index.ts`

### 2. Fix `documents`

Do ONE of the following (choose the correct one based on repo state):

**Option A — Documents is gone**

* Remove ALL references to:

  * `./documents`
  * document classifiers
  * floorplan document utilities
* Remove any imports in `apps/unified-portal` that reference document APIs

**Option B — Documents should exist**

* Recreate `packages/api/src/documents/index.ts`
* Explicitly export only real files
* No wildcard exports to missing paths

DO NOT GUESS. MATCH REAL FILES.

---

### 3. Enforce explicit exports

Replace wildcard exports with **explicit exports only**.

Bad:

```ts
export * from './documents'
```

Good:

```ts
export { processFloorplanUpload } from './floorplan-storage'
export type { FloorplanUploadResult } from './floorplan-storage'
```

If a module is not required by the app, REMOVE IT.

---

### 4. Validate workspace boundaries

Ensure:

* `apps/unified-portal` only imports from `@openhouse/api`
* No deep imports into `packages/api/src/**`
* No circular references

---

### 5. Verify build locally

Run:

```bash
npm run build --workspace=apps/unified-portal
```

The task is NOT complete unless:

* Build exits with code 0
* No webpack module resolution errors
* No missing exports

---

### 6. Lock it in

After success:

* Do NOT add new exports
* Do NOT add new dependencies
* Do NOT modify Vercel config

The goal is **stability**, not feature work.

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

When finished, report:

1. Which exports were removed or fixed
2. Which files were recreated (if any)
3. Confirmation that the build passes cleanly

DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE BUILD PASSES.
