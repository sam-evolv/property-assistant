Rathard Park onboarding currently forces manual unit creation via the “Add Unit Type” modal. This is incorrect. Units must be onboarded primarily via Excel upload, consistent with Longview Park.

Bulk unit import already exists at:
/super/projects/[projectId]/import-units

We need to surface and enforce the correct workflow.

NON-NEGOTIABLES

No schema changes

No API changes

No new libraries

Do not alter branding, tokens, or layout system

No em dashes in UI copy

Keep Longview Park behaviour unchanged

Do not remove manual unit creation, only demote it

TASKS
1. Fix the Unit Types empty state UX

File:
apps/unified-portal/app/super/projects/[projectId]/unit-types/page.tsx
(or equivalent unit-types page component)

When:

Project has zero units

Replace the current empty state with:

Primary CTA

“Upload Units via Excel”

Button links to:
/super/projects/[projectId]/import-units

Secondary CTA

“Add Unit Type Manually”

Opens existing modal (unchanged)

Copy

“This project has no units yet. Upload an Excel file to create units in bulk, or add unit types manually.”

2. Add a blocking onboarding guard (same pattern as Setup Required)

When:

Project has unit types

Project has zero units

Show an amber Setup Required panel at the top of:

Units page

Unit Types page

Overview page (project-scoped only)

Copy:

“Units have not been uploaded for this project. Upload an Excel file to complete setup.”

CTA:

“Upload Excel”

Routes to /super/projects/[projectId]/import-units

3. Ensure manual unit creation is never the default path

Do not auto-open the “Add Unit Type” modal

Do not show “No unit types yet” as a blocking state

Excel upload must always be visible and obvious

4. Verify Longview Park is untouched

Longview Park continues to work exactly as before

No changes to its data, units, or flows

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (must be confirmed)

New project → Unit Types page shows Excel-first CTA

Excel upload creates all units correctly

Manual unit creation still works

No new API calls added

No schema changes

No regressions in Longview Park

OUTPUT

List files changed

Confirm Excel upload is now the primary onboarding path

Confirm manual unit creation remains optional

What this gives you strategically

True developer-scale onboarding

No perception of “admin busywork”

Clean parity between Longview Park and Rathard Park

A demo-safe, investor-safe flow

Zero technical risk
