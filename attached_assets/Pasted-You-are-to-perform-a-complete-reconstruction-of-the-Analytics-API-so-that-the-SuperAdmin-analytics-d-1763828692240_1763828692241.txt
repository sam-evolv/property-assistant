You are to perform a complete reconstruction of the Analytics API so that the SuperAdmin analytics dashboard in apps/unified-portal/app/analytics/page.tsx loads real data from the database and analytics-engine.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
1. Rebuild all analytics API endpoints:
   - /api/analytics/summary
   - /api/analytics/development/[devId]/overview
   - /api/analytics/development/[devId]/documents
   - /api/analytics/development/[devId]/interactions
   - /api/analytics/development/[devId]/usage
   - (Any others referenced in the dashboard)

2. Ensure these endpoints:
   - Import from packages/db correctly
   - Import from packages/analytics-engine correctly
   - Use the updated Drizzle schema
   - Are server components using Next.js 14 conventions
   - Return the exact data shape expected by the dashboard UI

3. Remove all legacy or invalid paths:
   - Delete all references to the old "analytics" folder
   - Delete all broken imports referencing removed code
   - Ensure no API routes call non-existent modules

4. Rebuild analytics-engine exports:
   - createAnalyticsSummary()
   - developmentAnalytics()
   - documentAnalytics()
   - interactionAnalytics()
   - usageAnalytics()

5. Guarantee the following dashboard metrics load and match real data:
   - Total platform interactions
   - Document downloads
   - Documents viewed
   - Total units onboarded
   - GPT chat messages
   - Per-development metrics (Longview Park must appear)
   - 24h / 7d / 30d activity windows

6. Update all fetch() calls in page.tsx and components/analytics/*.tsx to use the corrected endpoints.

7. Deploy and verify:
   - SuperAdmin dashboard loads with NO spinner
   - Real values from the DB populate the graphs and cards
   - No more “Failed to fetch platform metrics”
   - No more 500 errors
   - No more blank screen

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT touch authentication logic unless necessary
- Do NOT alter UI components except for adjusting their expected API response shapes
- Maintain existing TypeScript types where possible
- Add new types only if required for analytics returns

AFTER CODE COMPLETION
- Run the dev server
- Open the analytics page
- Confirm all charts and cards render with real data
- Confirm Longview Park appears and metrics are correct

BEGIN NOW.
