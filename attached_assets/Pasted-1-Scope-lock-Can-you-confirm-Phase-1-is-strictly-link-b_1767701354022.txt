1) Scope lock

“Can you confirm Phase 1 is strictly link-based embeds (YouTube/Vimeo) and we are not building uploads, storage, transcoding, or streaming?”

“Can you confirm push notifications are excluded from pre-launch scope and will be a separate Phase 2?”

2) Zero-regression guarantee

“With FEATURE_VIDEOS=false, can you guarantee there is zero runtime impact on existing Docs (queries, components, loading performance) and no changes to current behaviour?”

“Which exact files will you modify to add the Videos tab, and can you confirm you will not touch the ‘DO NOT MODIFY’ list?”

3) Architecture sanity check

“Can you confirm the videos feature will be implemented as a new table and new API routes only, with no edits to archive/RAG pipelines, document_sections queries, or Smart Archive logic?”

“Can you confirm this will work across multi-scheme tenancy, using the same scheme context as Docs, with RLS matching existing access patterns?”

4) iOS in-app playback reality check

“Can you demonstrate in a test build that a YouTube/Vimeo embed plays fully in-app (WKWebView) without opening Safari, including on iOS Low Power Mode and typical network conditions?”

“What is the fallback behaviour if embedding is blocked (video owner disables embedding, removed video, restricted content)? What will the homeowner see?”

5) Operational UX (developer friction)

“Can you confirm the developer workflow is: paste link, auto-detect provider, preview, publish - with validation that the link is embeddable before saving?”

“How many clicks from ‘Add Video’ to ‘homeowners can watch it in-app’ in the final UI?”

6) Performance and stability

“Will the Videos tab introduce any new heavy client bundles, dependencies, or render-blocking scripts that could worsen load time or the scrolling issues we had previously?”

“Will any third-party scripts (YouTube/Vimeo) load only when the Videos tab or video modal is opened (lazy-loaded), not on initial page load?”

7) Security, privacy, and compliance

“Can you confirm videos are scheme-scoped and cannot be accessed cross-scheme even if someone guesses a resource ID (RLS enforced, not just UI hidden)?”

“Can you confirm we are not exposing private homeowner identifiers to YouTube/Vimeo beyond standard embed behaviour, and we are not sending user data to third parties unnecessarily?”

8) Delivery confidence and rollback

“What is the smallest shippable increment you can deliver first (DB + read-only list + playback), and can we deploy it behind flags without enabling it for any live scheme?”

“If anything goes wrong, what is the rollback plan - can we disable with a single env var flip and redeploy, and does that fully remove the surface area (UI and API)?”

“What are the top 3 realistic failure modes you foresee in our codebase, and how will you mitigate each?”

9) ROI proof built in (to make it worth it)

“Can you add minimal analytics events (video page opened, video started, acknowledged watched) without risking stability, so we can prove reduction in callouts and justify expansion?”
