Implement CONCIERGE ESCALATION behaviour when the assistant cannot answer with sufficient confidence.

Goal:
When the assistant cannot confirm something, it should still help by:
- identifying the correct party to contact (developer vs OMC vs installer)
- providing a message template and what info to include
- never inventing contact details
- using scheme contacts only when present in data

Constraints:
- Never hallucinate phone numbers or email addresses.
- If no contacts exist, provide role-based guidance and what to ask for.
- Must be Ireland appropriate.
- Must be safe behind a feature flag.

Implementation Plan:
1) Add feature flag:
   ASSISTANT_CONCIERGE_ESCALATION=true

2) Create escalation router:
   /lib/assistant/escalation.ts

Inputs:
- intent
- confidence
- gap_reason
- scheme contacts (from scheme config or docs)
- session memory context (block, issue type)

Outputs:
- escalation_target: "developer" | "omc" | "installer" | "emergency_services"
- message_template: a short copy-paste message
- required_fields: [unit_uid, block, issue_summary, photos?, preferred_contact_time?]
- disclaimer: only when needed

3) Integrate with existing gap logger:
   When gap reason is:
   - missing_scheme_data
   - no_documents_found
   - low_doc_confidence
   - validation_failed
   auto-append escalation guidance.

4) Add scheme contacts structure:
   Prefer to read from scheme_profile or a scheme_contacts table if you have one.
   If not present, do not invent. Use placeholders:
   "Contact the management company (OMC) using the details in your welcome pack."

5) Output style:
   - Friendly, calm.
   - Short.
   - Include "What to include" as a short list.

6) Tests:
   - If no contacts exist, template must not contain fake emails/phones.
   - If contacts exist, must cite them accurately.

Deliverables:
- /lib/assistant/escalation.ts
- /lib/assistant/escalation-templates.ts (Ireland-specific)
- integration into response composer when low confidence
- test coverage
