Redesign social housing rows - current design looks broken, needs to be intentional and polished.
The current social housing rows show endless "—" dashes across all columns which looks like missing data, not a different unit type. The lonely EST. CLOSE date at the end makes it worse.
New Design Approach - Merged/Collapsed Row:
For social housing units (sale_type = 'social'), instead of showing all columns with empty dashes:

Merge the middle columns into a single span:

UNIT/PURCHASER column: Show unit number, type badge (BT01), and "Social Housing" label as normal
PRICE column: Show "—" or "N/A" (no sale price for social)
RELEASE through COUNTER columns: Merge into ONE cell that spans across all these columns and displays a clean label like:

"Social Housing - Clúid" centered in a subtle teal/slate pill badge
Or simply leave it as an elegant empty merged cell with a very subtle background


KITCHEN, SNAG, DRAWDOWN, HANDOVER: Show actual dates if available, or "—" if not
PROGRESS: Show progress based on handover status
EST. CLOSE: Show date if available


Visual Treatment:

Subtle warm grey background (#FAFAF9) for the entire row
The merged middle section should feel intentional, not broken
No individual cell borders in the merged section
A refined "Clúid" or "Social" badge in the UNIT column (teal/slate, not garish)


Alternative Simpler Approach:

Keep all columns but instead of "—" in each cell, show nothing (empty)
Add a subtle left border accent in teal/slate to indicate social housing
The row should feel "quiet" not "broken"

Key Principles:

It should be immediately obvious these are different, but look designed not broken
The eye should flow naturally past them when scanning private sales
When you do look at them, they should feel complete and intentional
No awkward orphaned cells or misaligned elements
