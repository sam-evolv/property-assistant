You are the Replit Agent. Redesign the Purchaser Docs Videos section so it is production-quality, compact, and consistent with the Docs UI.

CONTEXT
Current implementation renders a large "Videos (1)" block with an oversized thumbnail area that looks like a banner and breaks the Docs layout. This must be reformatted so it looks intentional and premium.

GOALS
1) Make Videos feel like a first-class Docs category, not an awkward block.
2) Prevent Videos from dominating vertical space.
3) Responsive, clean layout: 2-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile.
4) Clicking a video opens a responsive modal player (not inline giant banner).
5) No regressions: do not touch archive/RAG protected files. Keep changes isolated to purchaser docs UI and video components.

REQUIREMENTS
- Keep existing data and API. Only change UI rendering and component structure.
- Videos section should render only when at least 1 video exists.
- If 0 videos, do not render the section at all.
- Use Tailwind + existing design tokens if present.
- Ensure accessibility: keyboard focus trap for modal, ESC to close, close button visible.
- Ensure embed is responsive and does not overflow.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
A) Locate purchaser Docs page/component where Videos is rendered (likely apps/unified-portal/app/purchaser/app/* docs tab component).
B) Replace current Videos block UI with:
   - Header row: "Handover Videos" + count badge (e.g. 1)
   - Subtext: "Short walkthroughs that help you use your home systems correctly."
   - Grid of cards:
     - Thumbnail (16:9) with play icon overlay
     - Title
     - Description (clamp to 2 lines)
     - Metadata row: duration (if known) + provider badge (YouTube/Vimeo)
     - CTA button: Watch
C) Modal player:
   - Opens on Watch or card click
   - Shows title, description
   - Responsive iframe embed (max width 900px, height maintains 16:9)
   - Close button top-right, ESC closes, click backdrop closes
   - If embed fails, show fallback text + "Open in browser" link
D) Visual polish:
   - Card hover: subtle lift/shadow
   - Consistent spacing with existing Docs cards
   - Avoid huge empty containers
   - Use skeleton loader while fetching videos

EDGE CASES
- Long titles and descriptions: clamp and avoid layout shift.
- Mobile: single column, modal fits viewport, video scales correctly.
- Ensure Videos section does not push the category chips off-screen or create horizontal scroll.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
1) On purchaser Docs, videos show as compact grid cards, not banner.
2) Layout remains clean with category chips and doc cards visible above/below.
3) Clicking Watch opens modal and plays video, closes cleanly.
4) With 0 videos, no Videos section appears.
5) Mobile view: no horizontal scroll, video modal responsive.
6) No changes to protected archive/RAG files.

Deliver the updated components and confirm which files were modified.
