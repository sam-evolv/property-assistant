Design Guidelines

Consistent with individual development Analysis page styling
Use brand gold (#D4AF37) for key metrics
Charts should be interactive with tooltips
Development colors should be consistent throughout (e.g., Longview = blue, Rathard Park = green, Rathard Lawn = purple)
Responsive layout - cards should stack on mobile
Loading states for each section

Data Source

Aggregate from unit_sales_pipeline joined with units and developments tables
Filter by tenant_id to show only the logged-in developer's developments
Exclude developments with 0 units
