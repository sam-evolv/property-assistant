You are refactoring my existing Next.js + Supabase project into a clean monorepo layout that will support a SaaS product called OpenHouse AI.
Do not break any existing routes or behaviours. Work incrementally and explain what you are doing in your logs.

Current state (from what you can see in this Replit):

There is a monorepo-style project with folders like apps/tenant-portal, packages/db, etc.

The admin console is currently available under routes like /admin/developments within apps/tenant-portal.

Supabase + Drizzle are configured under packages/db.

Target architecture for Phase 1 (structure only, no new features):

Keep using a single Next.js app for now, but introduce a clear folder naming scheme that matches our SaaS architecture:

apps/admin-portal – my global OpenHouse admin console (currently the existing admin console).

apps/developer-portal – developer-facing dashboard (for now it can share components/routes with admin-portal or be a thin wrapper).

apps/resident-app – resident-facing chat interface (can be a small placeholder for now if not yet implemented).

Keep packages/db as the single source of truth for Drizzle + Supabase.

Add a placeholder apps/marketing folder that will later host the openhouse.ai marketing site (simple Next.js app with a single landing page is enough for now).

Concrete tasks:

Inspect the current project structure and summarise it in your log so I can see what exists (apps, packages, config files, etc.).

If everything currently lives under apps/tenant-portal, refactor as follows:

Duplicate or move the relevant admin-specific routes and layout into apps/admin-portal.

Ensure /admin/* routes are still working and are now owned by apps/admin-portal (if you need to use Next.js rewrites or a multi-app pattern, configure that in next.config.js without breaking existing paths).

Leave tenant-facing or resident-facing routes in apps/tenant-portal for now, but comment in the code where these will later migrate to apps/developer-portal and apps/resident-app.

Create apps/developer-portal and apps/resident-app as minimal Next.js app-directory apps with:

A shared layout that matches the current styling.

A simple placeholder page (e.g. “Developer Portal coming soon”, “Resident App coming soon”), so we know routing and structure are working.

Create a minimal apps/marketing app with a single landing page that says “OpenHouse AI Platform – Marketing Shell” so we know it is wired.

Update package.json scripts so I can run each app explicitly in development mode if required, and/or ensure a single npm run dev still starts the main app correctly.

Do not change any database schemas, Supabase URLs, training code, or chat logic in this phase. This refactor is only about structure and routing.

Success criteria:

I can still open /admin/developments/new in the Preview and create a development successfully.

There are clearly separated folders for: apps/admin-portal, apps/developer-portal, apps/resident-app, apps/marketing.

The Agent prints a short final summary of what changed and which dev commands to use to run the app(s).
