CRITICAL BUG: Multiple security and provisioning failures during developer signup
A user just signed up with an invitation code (samdonfx@gmail.com) but has full super_admin access. Multiple things are broken:
Problem 1: No admin record created
The signup flow was supposed to call /api/auth/provision-developer to create an admin record, but NO record exists:
sqlSELECT * FROM admins WHERE email = 'samdonfx@gmail.com';
-- Returns 0 rows
Problem 2: Dashboard shows ALL developers
The "Developer" dropdown in the sidebar shows "All Developers" plus every developer company (OpenHouse AI, Longview Estates, etc.). A new developer should ONLY see their own company.
Problem 3: Dashboard shows ALL schemes/developments
The "Current Scheme" dropdown shows ALL schemes across ALL developers (Longview Park, OpenHouse Park, Rathard Lawn, Rathard Park). A new developer should see ZERO schemes since they haven't created any yet.
Problem 4: Dashboard shows wrong user name
The dashboard says "Good evening, Sam" but the user who signed up entered "Test Flow" as their name. It's pulling the wrong user's name from somewhere.
Problem 5: Fallback to super_admin
When no admin record exists, the app is defaulting to super_admin access instead of showing "Access Not Configured" or denying access.
Root causes to investigate:

Is /api/auth/provision-developer being called? Add logging.
Is it failing silently? Check for try/catch swallowing errors.
Why does AuthContext/middleware grant super_admin when no admin record exists?
Where does the dashboard get the user's display name? It should come from the current session, not a hardcoded value or wrong user.
The TenantSwitcher and DevelopmentSwitcher components should be hidden entirely for non-super_admin users.

Expected behavior for a new developer signup:

Admin record created with role: 'developer' and correct tenant_id
Dashboard shows ONLY their company name (no dropdown)
Schemes dropdown shows ONLY their developments (empty for new signup)
Greeting shows THEIR name from signup form
Zero visibility into other developers' data
