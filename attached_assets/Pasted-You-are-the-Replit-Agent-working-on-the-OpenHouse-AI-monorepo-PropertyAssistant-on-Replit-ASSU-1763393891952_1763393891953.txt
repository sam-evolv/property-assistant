You are the Replit Agent working on the OpenHouse AI monorepo (PropertyAssistant on Replit).

ASSUMED STATE AFTER PREVIOUS PASS:
- Developer Portal works.
- I can log in as super admin.
- I can see Longview Park in the Developments list.
- I can open Longview Park.
- I can upload at least one Longview Park PDF.
- `/api/train` stores the document + chunks.
- `/api/chat` can answer questions about Longview Park via Preview Chat.

YOUR OBJECTIVE IN THIS PASS ONLY:

Build a **clean, reliable, mobile-first Tenant Portal vertical slice** for Longview Park so that:

- A “resident” can open a URL (simulating QR scan) for Longview Park.
- The app clearly shows they are in Longview Park.
- They can ask questions about their home/estate and get correct answers via RAG.
- They can view the core documents for their estate.
- The experience feels simple, intuitive, and visually coherent (baseline white/black/gold styling).
- It works well on mobile.

Do NOT just plan or summarise.  
You must modify code, implement UI and logic, and show diffs.

────────────────────────────────────────
0. ORIENTATION & ROUTING CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────

1. This pass focuses exclusively on **apps/tenant-portal** (homeowner-facing).
2. The minimum viable routing we need:

   - A route that represents a **development-level entry**, for example:
     - `/[developmentId]`
     - or `/developments/[developmentId]`
   - A dedicated Chat screen for the development.
   - A Documents screen for the development.
   - Optional: Map / Noticeboard placeholders if they already exist (but they are secondary).

3. For the pilot, you can treat:

   - Longview Park as a single development context (no house-specific logic required yet).
   - We must pass at least `developmentId` through the URL and into the Tenant Portal.

If routing differs (e.g. `/app/[slug]`), adapt accordingly, but keep one clear development-level entry point.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. DEFINE TENANT PORTAL ENTRY ROUTE
────────────────────────────────────────

Goal: A single, clean URL that loads the Tenant Portal for a given development.

1. Inspect the current routing under:
   - `apps/tenant-portal/src/app`

2. If there is NOT already a dynamic development route (e.g. `[developmentId]/page.tsx`), create one:

   Example structure (adjust to match actual Next.js App Router organisation):

   - `apps/tenant-portal/src/app/[developmentId]/layout.tsx`
   - `apps/tenant-portal/src/app/[developmentId]/page.tsx`

3. In `layout.tsx` for `[developmentId]`:
   - Extract `params.developmentId`.
   - Fetch development metadata from `/api/developments/{developmentId}` (via a shared API client or direct fetch(`/api/developments/${developmentId}`)).
   - Provide a simple context or props so child pages know:
     - `developmentId`
     - `developmentName`
     - `location` (if available)

   - Render a shell layout with:
     - A top header bar (white/black/gold) showing the estate name.
     - A main content area that is mobile-first.
     - If you already have a bottom navigation, wire it into this layout.

4. In `page.tsx` for `[developmentId]`:
   - Use the development metadata (from the layout or fresh fetch).
   - Show:
     - A friendly welcome title: “Welcome to Longview Park” (or the actual development name).
     - A short description line: “Your digital home assistant for this estate.”
     - 2–3 primary action cards/buttons:
       - “Ask a Question” → navigates to /[developmentId]/chat
       - “View Documents” → navigates to /[developmentId]/documents
       - Optional: “Explore Area Map” (if map/POI is wired) or leave as placeholder.

   - Keep the design:
     - White background.
     - Black typography.
     - Gold accent on buttons/cards.

Show diffs for all new/updated layout + entry page files.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. BUILD TENANT CHAT SCREEN (RAG-POWERED)
────────────────────────────────────────

Goal: Resident can ask questions and get correct answers based on the uploaded Longview Park documents.

1. Create or update a Chat route, for example:
   - `apps/tenant-portal/src/app/[developmentId]/chat/page.tsx`

2. Requirements for this Chat screen:
   - It must:
     - Read `developmentId` from params.
     - Display the development name at the top (e.g. as a header title).
     - Render a vertical list of message bubbles:
       - Resident messages on the right, minimal, white bubble.
       - Assistant messages on the left, black or white background with gold accent (border or label).
     - Show a text input + send button fixed at the bottom.
     - Handle mobile viewport gracefully (no overflow issues).

3. Wiring to `/api/chat`:
   - On submit:
     - POST to `/api/chat` with JSON body:

       ```json
       {
         "message": "...",
         "developmentId": "<developmentId-from-params>"
       }
       ```

   - While waiting:
     - Show a “typing…” indicator (three gold dots or similar) in the assistant area.
   - On success:
     - Append assistant response to the chat transcript.
   - On error:
     - Show a simple error banner or toast: “Something went wrong, please try again.”

4. Reuse the same RAG backend logic as Developer Portal Preview Chat:
   - The only difference is the UI and the fact that the user is a resident, not a developer.
   - Ensure the response remains grounded in the `developmentId` context.

5. Add a **friendly system message** on initial load:
   - Example:
     - “Hi, I’m your Longview Park assistant. Ask me anything about your home, your estate, or your documents.”

Show diffs for the chat page and any shared components you adjust.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. BUILD TENANT DOCUMENTS SCREEN
────────────────────────────────────────

Goal: Resident can view the key documents for their estate.

1. Create or update a Documents route, for example:
   - `apps/tenant-portal/src/app/[developmentId]/documents/page.tsx`

2. Behaviour:
   - Read `developmentId` from params.
   - Fetch documents for this development from a single endpoint such as:
     - `GET /api/documents?developmentId=<id>`
     - or `GET /api/developments/{id}/documents` if that already exists.

3. UI:
   - Display a simple, mobile-first list or card view of documents:
     - Document title / filename.
     - Upload date.
     - Optional: category tag if available (e.g. “Handover Pack”, “Manuals”, “Planning”).
   - Each document row/card should have:
     - A “View” or “Open” button that:
       - Either links directly to the Supabase file URL (if exposed via a signed URL API).
       - Or calls a backend route to get a secure download URL.

4. Error & Empty States:
   - If no documents:
     - Show a gentle message:
       - “Your documents are not available yet. Please check back soon.”
   - If error fetching documents:
     - Show a short error message and a “Try again” button.

Show diffs for this page and any API client helpers updated/created.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. OPTIONAL: BASIC MAP / NOTICEBOARD WIREFRAME (ONLY IF ALREADY PRESENT)
────────────────────────────────────────

This is **optional in this pass**, but if the repo already has partial implementations, you can stabilise them lightly.

Goals:
- Map page should load without errors.
- Noticeboard, if present, should at least render a static list or “coming soon” message.

1. Map:
   - Route example: `/[developmentId]/map`
   - Ensure:
     - Google Maps key is used **only client-side where appropriate**.
     - React component is dynamic imported to avoid SSR map issues.
     - Markers, if any, use gold/black styling.

2. Noticeboard:
   - Route example: `/[developmentId]/noticeboard`
   - Render either:
     - A simple list of posts if an API exists, or
     - “Community updates will appear here soon” placeholder.

Stabilise only; do not over-engineer in this pass.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. BASELINE WHITE / BLACK / GOLD THEMING FOR TENANT PORTAL
────────────────────────────────────────

Goal: The Tenant Portal should already feel like a cohesive OpenHouse AI product, not a raw scaffold.

1. Tailwind / theme:
   - If Tailwind is used, ensure the theme includes:
     - `oh-gold`: e.g. `#D4AF37` (or the gold you used elsewhere)
     - `oh-black`: `#000000` or `#0B0B0B`
     - `oh-white`: `#FFFFFF`
   - Use these in:
     - Header
     - Buttons
     - Key accents

2. Layout:
   - All Tenant Portal pages should:
     - Have consistent padding (e.g. `px-4 py-4` on mobile).
     - Use a consistent font size scale (clear hierarchy).
     - Avoid cramped layouts or excessive whitespace that looks accidental.

3. Components:
   - Buttons:
     - Primary = gold background, black text.
     - Secondary = black outline or minimal grey.
   - Cards:
     - White background, subtle shadow, gold accent (border or top line).

4. Mobile:
   - Test on a narrow viewport:
     - Chat input must be usable.
     - No horizontal scroll.
     - Buttons reachable with thumb.
     - Text readable.

You do NOT need a full design-system build here, but the Tenant Portal must feel intentional and visually consistent.

────────────────────────────────────────
6. ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE
────────────────────────────────────────

Goal: The Tenant Portal must **never hard-crash** for a resident.

1. For all key Tenant pages (`[developmentId]/page.tsx`, `/chat`, `/documents`):
   - Add:
     - Loading states while data is fetched.
     - Clear, simple error messages if fetching fails.
     - Fallback UI if `developmentId` is invalid:
       - “We couldn’t find this estate. Please contact your developer.”

2. All fetch calls should:
   - `try/catch` errors.
   - Log to console (or unify logging if already implemented).
   - Update UI state accordingly rather than leaving spinners forever.

Show diffs demonstrating error handling improvements.

────────────────────────────────────────
7. FULL END-TO-END TEST FOR LONGVIEW PARK TENANT FLOW
────────────────────────────────────────

After all code changes:

1. Start Tenant Portal dev server, if separate from Developer Portal:
   ```bash
   cd apps/tenant-portal
   npm run dev
Or confirm existing monorepo command if shared.

In the browser:

Navigate to the Tenant Portal route for Longview Park, e.g.:

http://localhost:3000/longview-park or

http://localhost:3000/<actual-development-id-or-slug>

Confirm:

The estate title appears.

The welcome screen looks clean and intentional.

“Ask a Question” navigates to Chat.

“View Documents” navigates to Documents.

Chat test:

Ask a few questions about Longview Park that rely on your uploaded PDF.

Confirm the answers are clearly grounded in your documents (not hallucinated).

Confirm no browser errors.

Documents test:

Confirm the list of documents is visible.

Open one and ensure the file serves correctly.

Mobile view:

Use DevTools responsive mode.

Confirm everything still works and feels usable.

Fix any issues you find within this pass before ending.

────────────────────────────────────────
8. DELIVERABLES FOR THIS PASS
────────────────────────────────────────

There is a working development-level Tenant entry route (e.g. /[developmentId]).

The Tenant Home screen:

Shows development name.

Offers clear primary actions.

Tenant Chat:

Works end-to-end with /api/chat.
