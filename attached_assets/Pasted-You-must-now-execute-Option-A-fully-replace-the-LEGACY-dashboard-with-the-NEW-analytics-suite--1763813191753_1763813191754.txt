You must now execute Option A: fully replace the LEGACY dashboard with the NEW analytics suite.

### OBJECTIVE
Make the new analytics system located at:
  /apps/unified-portal/app/analytics/
the **ONLY** dashboard experience for developers and enterprise users.

### PART 1 — REMOVE LEGACY DASHBOARD ROUTES
Delete or disable routing for:
  /developer
  /dashboard
  /dashboard-client.tsx
  /developer/dashboard-client.tsx
  /developer/page.tsx
  /dashboard/page.tsx

Remove all legacy components in:
  apps/unified-portal/components/admin-enterprise/charts/*
  apps/unified-portal/components/admin-enterprise/cards/*
(but DO NOT touch the new analytics components)

### PART 2 — PROMOTE ANALYTICS AS THE PRIMARY DASHBOARD
Create a new route:
  /developer  → should LOAD /analytics
  /dashboard  → should LOAD /analytics

Implement via Next.js App Router redirect:
- In app/developer/page.tsx → redirect to /analytics
- In app/dashboard/page.tsx → redirect to /analytics

Developer login landing page:
  / → should redirect authenticated developer to /analytics

Enterprise admin login landing page:
  /admin → redirect to /analytics

### PART 3 — UPDATE NAVIGATION
In the unified portal navigation components:
  components/layouts/dev-sidebar.tsx
  components/layouts/navbar.tsx
  components/layouts/sidebar.tsx

Do the following:
1. Remove “Dashboard”
2. Remove “Analytics” (duplicate)
3. Add **ONE** button:
     “Dashboard”
     href: /analytics
4. Ensure consistent styling theme (black / gold / white)

### PART 4 — REMOVE LEGACY API ROUTES
Delete or disable:
  /api/analytics/dashboard/route.ts
  /api/analytics/summary/route.ts
(any route that powers the old dashboard)

Ensure the new analytics API routes remain:
  /api/analytics/message-volume
  /api/analytics/documents
  /api/analytics/top-questions
  /api/analytics/rag-performance
  /api/analytics/knowledge-gaps
  (all others created in Phase 5.7)

### PART 5 — ADD QUALITY POLISH
- Add loading skeletons to the analytics page
- Add consistent page header: “Developer Analytics Dashboard”
- Ensure all tabs remain working
- Ensure all tabs use premium black/gold theme

### PART 6 — SMOKE TEST
Run the following tests:

1. Visit /developer → should show new analytics
2. Visit /dashboard → should show new analytics
3. Login as developer → land on analytics
4. Check navigation — only one “Dashboard” item
5. Ensure NO legacy charts render anywhere

### PART 7 — LOG EVERYTHING
Write completion summary to:
  logs/PHASE_5.8_ANALYTICS_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md

Include:
- Files removed
- Files updated
- Redirects implemented
- Navigation changes
- Confirmed smoke test results
