You are restoring and rebuilding ONLY the Purchaser Portal at apps/unified-portal.
You must NOT modify the Developer Dashboard or SuperAdmin Dashboard.
All work must be limited strictly to the purchaser user frontend.

🎨 1. VISUAL + UX TARGET (Non-Negotiable Requirements)

The Purchaser Portal must match — and improve upon — the visual layouts shown in these screenshots:

Use them ONLY for layout and UX references — not colour scheme.
You must apply our actual theme: white background, navy text, subtle greys, gold accents, radius-heavy, soft shadow, modern, premium, clean.

The UI should feel like:

ChatGPT mobile

Gemini mobile

Apple Wallet-level polish
Nothing clunky. No mismatched colours. No old components.

🎬 2. HOME / CHAT SCREEN — MUST BE RESTORED + UPGRADED

The Chat tab must open to this exact structure:

(A) Centered Logo

Circular logo in the middle

Clean, premium, lightweight

(B) Welcome Message

Large bold header:
“Welcome to Longview Park”
or dynamic development name

Subtext below:
“Ask us anything about your home or community.”

(C) Four Pill-Style Quick Action Buttons

Small rounded pills just like in screenshots.
Examples (dynamic):

“When is my bin day?”

“What heating system do I have?”

“Show me my documents”

“Find nearby shops”

(D) Chat Interface Layout

Messages with correct bubble styling (gold for user, dark navy for assistant)

Proper timestamps

Correct loading animation

Text input + microphone icon at the bottom

Absolutely must allow typing (current broken)

(E) Chat Brain

Questions must:

Pull correct house type

Pull documents

Never ask “what’s your address?”

Never error unless truly necessary

Pull heat pump type, boiler model, meter info, etc., from unit + docs

Use RAG properly

Answer every question reliably

🗺️ 3. MAPS TAB — MUST BE RESTORED + FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Current implementation is incorrect (it reverted to OSM + broken markers).
You must restore the MVP structure.

Requirements

Use Google Maps API (not OSM)

Automatically center on actual unit address

Display a filter bar with these categories:

Filters Required:

Banking

Bars

Cafés

DIY

Dog Park

Schools

EV Charging

Fuel

Shopping

Parks

Medical

Behaviour

Tapping a filter queries Google Places

Shows pins on the map

Map interaction must be fluid

DO NOT USE YELLOW ANYWHERE.

Must use our white/navy/gold premium theme.

📄 4. DOCUMENTS TAB — MUST BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The agent incorrectly believes this is “done”.
It is not done.

Correct Required Behaviour

When a unit loads:

Fetch all documents belonging to the development

Display all global documents (documents without a house type tag)

Also display only the drawings for that unit’s house type

Examples:

Unit is BDO1
→ show only drawings named like BDO1 - Floor Plan.pdf

Do not show BDO2/BSO2 drawings for that unit

All non-unit-specific docs appear for everyone

Layout

Grid layout (like screenshot), not an accordion

Clean PDF cards with:

Icon

File name

Tap to open

Currently: Nothing loads. Must be fixed.

📢 5. NOTICEBOARD TAB

Keep the Noticeboard simple

Floating blue outline “+” button

Simple card layout

Editable notices

Matches screenshots provided

🌍 6. LANGUAGE SWITCHING

Must provide a functional EN dropdown

With flag icon

Ability to switch to EN/ES/PL at minimum

Full UI must update

Chat messages remain in chosen language unless reset

Current dropdown is non-functional — must be fixed.

🎨 7. UNIVERSAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS

Absolutely remove all yellows from random UI elements

Only use our gold accent intentionally

Radius-heavy card layouts

Soft shadows

Clean spacing

Consistent typography

Bottom navigation bar must remain

Icons must match the original design (outline, clean, modern)

Nothing should look hacky, rushed, or mismatched.

❗ 8. DO NOT MODIFY

Developer dashboard (apps/developer-portal)

SuperAdmin dashboard (apps/admin-dashboard)

QR code onboarding (works fine)

Authentication flows

Only purchaser portal UI/UX + functionality.

🧠 9. RAG BEHAVIOUR

The assistant must:

Answer every question correctly

Use documents + metadata

Use house type

Never ask for address

Never fail to load RAG context

Must read PDF content

Must use metadata (house type, unit number, purchaser name)

🧹 10. QUALITY BAR

Everything must meet:

ChatGPT-level smooth UI

Apple-level spacing

Gemini-level cleanliness

No regressions

No weird margins

No broken buttons

No styling mismatches

No placeholder text left in production

No console errors

This should be better than the screenshots, not worse.

🏁 Goal

Fully restore the Purchaser Portal to the premium experience shown in the screenshots — then upgrade it to a production-quality, modern, elegant, high-performance interface that matches EvolvAI standards.
