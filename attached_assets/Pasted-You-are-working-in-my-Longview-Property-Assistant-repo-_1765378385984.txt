You are working in my Longview Property Assistant repo in Replit.

Goal:
The Noticeboard currently functions correctly but feels cheap, like a basic comment section. We want it to feel more like a modern, lightweight social feed inside an estate app, while using the same data model.

Scope:
- Purchaser portal Noticeboard only.
- Do not change Supabase schema or back end logic unless absolutely required.
- No changes to Developer or Admin dashboards.

Tasks:

1. Find the Noticeboard components:
   - Locate the React or Next.js page and components that render the notices and comments for the Purchaser portal.

2. Redesign the UI styling at component level:
   - Implement a card style layout for each notice.
     - Clear title, body, timestamp, and author.
     - Subtle shadow and rounded corners.
   - Display comments in a nested thread style with indentation, smaller font, and subtle dividers.
   - Ensure spacing, padding, and line height are generous enough to feel premium.

3. Visual polish:
   - Use consistent typography with the rest of the Purchaser portal, not something that looks like a default forum.
   - Add small touches like:
     - A clean header row for each card with author name and timestamp.
     - Optional initial avatar circle with the first letter of the poster’s name.
   - Modern but understated, not flashy.

4. Interaction:
   - Make sure posting a new notice or comment feels smooth, with clear input fields and buttons.
   - Ensure loading and empty states look intentional and designed, not just plain text.

5. Responsiveness:
   - Optimise for mobile first. It should look excellent on a phone, since that is how residents will use it.
   - Cards should stack nicely, with no horizontal scroll.

6. Test:
   - Populate the Noticeboard with several dummy notices and comments.
   - Confirm the layout is readable, visually coherent, and feels like a high quality product, not a cheap forum.

Do not change any API routes or database structures, only the front end layout and styling of the Purchaser Noticeboard.
