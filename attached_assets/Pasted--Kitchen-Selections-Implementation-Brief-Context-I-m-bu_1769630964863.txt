# Kitchen Selections - Implementation Brief

## Context

I'm building a developer dashboard for OpenHouse AI, a property-tech platform that replaces paper handover folders with an AI-powered resident portal. The platform needs to feel premium, polished, and worth paying for.

I've attached a ZIP file containing React components, Supabase hooks, and database schema for a new **Kitchen Selections** feature. This replaces the current card-based Kitchen Selections page with a clean, simple table view.

## Your Task

Implement these components into the existing codebase, but **match the existing styling patterns** already in the project. The attached components have functional logic that works - your job is to:

1. **Integrate the components** into the project structure
2. **Adapt the styling** to perfectly match the existing design language used elsewhere in the developer dashboard (look at Sales Pipeline for reference)
3. **Run the database schema** in Supabase
4. **Wire up the routing** and data connections
5. **Polish everything** to world-class standard

## Design Requirements

This needs to look **beautiful, premium, and stupidly simple**. The target users are property developers who are typically older and not tech-savvy. They need to understand what they're looking at within 5 seconds.

**Reference:** Look at the Sales Pipeline table (`/developer/pipeline`) - the Kitchen Selections table should feel like it belongs in the same family. Same visual weight, same interaction patterns, same level of polish.

**Key principles:**
- Clean white backgrounds with subtle borders
- Gold accent color (#D4AF37) for primary actions and progress
- Generous whitespace - don't cram things together
- Obvious visual hierarchy - addresses should pop, status should be glanceable
- Smooth micro-interactions on all interactive elements
- No visual clutter - if something doesn't need to be there, remove it

## Functional Requirements

**The Table:**
- Each row = one unit in the development
- Columns: Address, Purchaser, Kitchen (Y/N), Counter, Units, Handle, Wardrobe (Y/N), Style, Status, Updated, Comments
- Address should be prominent (e.g., "1 Longview Park") with unit type badge below
- Dropdowns for all selection fields
- When Kitchen = "No", disable Counter/Units/Handle dropdowns
- When Wardrobe = "No", disable Style dropdown
- Status auto-calculates: "Complete" when all required fields filled, "Pending" otherwise
- Status syncs back to Sales Pipeline when complete

**Settings Modal:**
- Developer defines their available options (counter types, unit finishes, handle styles, wardrobe styles)
- Options apply to all units in the development
- Simple add/remove interface with chips

**Filter & Search:**
- Tabs: All Units | Complete | Pending (with counts)
- Search by address or purchaser name

**Progress:**
- Progress bar showing X% complete
- "Send Reminders" button for pending selections

## What Success Looks Like

When done, this page should:
- Load instantly with skeleton states
- Feel buttery smooth when interacting with dropdowns
- Be immediately obvious what each column means
- Make the developer feel like they're using premium software
- Match the rest of the dashboard so perfectly that it looks like it was always there

## Important Notes

- The database schema includes RLS policies - make sure they work with your existing auth setup
- The hooks use `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` - adapt to whatever Supabase client pattern you're using
- Connect the comments button to the existing smart comments system
- If column names in the database differ from what the hooks expect, adjust accordingly

## Quality Bar

This is going in front of property developers who will judge the entire platform based on first impressions. Every pixel matters. Every interaction should feel considered. No rough edges.

Make it beautiful. Make it simple. Make it work.
