You are a senior full-stack engineer. We have a multi-tenant purchaser portal (Longview Park, Rathard Park, Rathard Lawn). A regression has occurred:

Symptoms
- Intro now shows: “Welcome to your development” instead of the actual development name (Rathard Park / Rathard Lawn / Longview Park).
- Intro no longer shows full address; it only shows owner name + house number (no street / full formatted address).
- Inside the portal, logos have reverted to Longview Park for Rathard Park and Rathard Lawn tenants (wrong branding/tenant assets).
- I rolled back to the commit where the “stale cache fallback logic was tightened” (maps/poi change). At that point this app was previously working perfectly, but now it’s not. So we must investigate why the current code/data state is inconsistent with expected behavior.

Goal
Reinstate: each portal must be perfectly aligned with its own estate.
- Intro: “Welcome to Rathard Park” / “Welcome to Rathard Lawn” / “Welcome to Longview Park”
- Intro shows: purchaser name + unit number + full address (house number + street + area + county etc as stored)
- Portal UI shows correct logo (header toolbar center and anywhere else) for the tenant’s development.

Non-negotiables
- Do not hardcode per-estate values in the UI.
- Fix must be data-driven, tenant-safe, and resilient (no silent fallback to Longview unless the tenant truly is Longview).
- Add safeguards so this never regresses again.
- Translation + demo seed changes have been rolled back; do not reintroduce them. Focus on tenant/development resolution + branding.

Process (follow strictly)

PHASE 1: Reproduce + observe
1) Identify the exact route/URL pattern used to open a purchaser portal (e.g. /p/:unitId, /portal/:slug, /u/:code, etc).
2) Reproduce for:
   - a Rathard Park unit
   - a Rathard Lawn unit
   - a Longview Park unit
3) Add temporary, dev-only logging (server and client) to print:
   - resolved tenantId / orgId
   - resolved projectId / developmentId
   - resolved unitId
   - resolved branding payload (logo URL, development name)
   - resolved address fields used to format “full address”
4) Capture where “Welcome to your development” is being chosen and where logos are being chosen.

PHASE 2: Identify the data source + resolution chain
5) Locate the code responsible for:
   A) fetching “current unit” and “current development”
   B) fetching “branding / logo”
   C) formatting the address shown in intro
6) Trace the dependency chain end-to-end:
   - Entry parameter (unitId? accessCode? slug?)
   - API call(s)
   - DB query
   - returned JSON
   - client state store (context/provider/zustand/redux)
   - component rendering

PHASE 3: Root cause analysis (most likely failure modes)
7) Check for a fallback default object used when development/tenant is missing. Specifically search for:
   - “your development”
   - “Longview”
   - DEFAULT_TENANT, DEFAULT_DEVELOPMENT, fallbackBranding, seedBranding
   - “??” / “||” style defaults in the branding resolver
8) Validate whether the wrong development is being returned by the API, or returned correctly but overwritten on the client.
9) Confirm whether the logos are:
   - being selected by “developmentId” but that ID is wrong
   - being selected by “slug” but slug mapping is wrong
   - being cached globally (cross-tenant cache key collision)
   - being loaded from an environment default (e.g. NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOGO)
10) Inspect any caching layer:
   - server in-memory cache, edge cache, localStorage, indexedDB
   - ensure cache keys include tenantId/developmentId/unit
