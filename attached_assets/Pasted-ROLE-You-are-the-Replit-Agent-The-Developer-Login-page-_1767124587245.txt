ROLE: You are the Replit Agent. The Developer Login page is approved. Your sole task is to introduce a clearly visible but still elegant gold light emanation from the OpenHouse AI logo. This must be perceptible at a glance, not hypothetical.

DO NOT modify layout, typography, card styling, inputs, or button styles.
ONLY adjust the logo aura / glow treatment.

THE PROBLEM TO FIX
- The gold glow is currently either missing or too subtle to register.
- The logo breathes, but it does not feel like a light source.
- We need the impression that a soft gold light is gently shining outward from the logo.

TARGET VISUAL EFFECT
Think:
- A calm, warm gold light behind the logo
- Like a diffused spotlight or halo
- Always present at a base level
- Slightly intensifies during the “breathing in” phase
- Never disappears entirely

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1) BASE GOLD HUE (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
- Add a constant, low-level gold aura behind the logo.
- This should be visible even when the logo is at rest.
- Use a radial gradient or pseudo-element behind the logo:
  - Centered exactly on the logo
  - Warm gold tone
  - Large radius, very soft falloff
- Opacity target:
  - Enough that you can clearly see it on black
  - But still tasteful (not neon, not yellow).

2) BREATHING INTENSIFICATION (SYNCED)
- During the existing breathing animation:
  - Slightly increase the glow’s opacity and spread
  - As the logo scales up, the light should feel like it’s gently radiating outward
- During the “breathing out” phase:
  - The glow reduces slightly
  - But NEVER fades to zero

3) VISUAL CHARACTER (IMPORTANT)
- This is NOT a ring.
- This is NOT a sharp halo.
- This is NOT a pulse flash.
- It should read as ambient light, not an effect.
- Soft edges only. Large blur radius.

4) TECHNICAL NOTES
- Implement via ::before or ::after on the logo wrapper.
- Use transform + opacity only.
- GPU-friendly.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion (keep base glow, disable animation).
- Ensure the glow does not clip at card edges.

5) GOLD TONE
- Use brand-adjacent gold, slightly desaturated.
- Avoid pure yellow.
- Think “warm metallic reflection”, not UI highlight.

ABSOLUTE NO-GOS
- No sparkles
- No particles
- No flicker
- No sudden brightness jumps
- No visible animation seams

ACCEPTANCE TEST
Open the page and ask:
“Can I clearly see a soft gold light shining from the logo on a black background?”

If the answer is not an immediate yes, increase the base glow slightly until it is.

STOP WHEN THIS IS TRUE
- The logo is the visual light source of the page.
- The glow is subtle but unmistakable.
- The page feels calmer, richer, and more premium than before.

Do not add anything else.
