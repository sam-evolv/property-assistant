You are working in my Longview Property Assistant repo in Replit.

Goal:
In the Purchaser portal Documents section, when the user clicks into the “All Documents” tab, we want the ordering to be:
1. Must read documents at the top.
2. Important documents next.
3. All remaining documents after that.
Within each group, a sensible secondary sort such as newest first.

Scope:
- Purchaser portal Documents view only.
- Do not break any existing filters or search.
- Do not change the meaning of must read or important flags, only the ordering.

Tasks:

1. Locate the Documents data fetching logic:
   - Identify the API route or direct Supabase query that powers the “All Documents” tab in the Purchaser portal.
   - Confirm which field or fields are used to mark documents as “must read” and “important”. For example, columns like `is_must_read`, `is_important`, `category`, or similar.

2. Implement explicit ordering:
   - Modify the query so the base ordering is:
     - `is_must_read` descending,
     - then `is_important` descending,
     - then `created_at` or `uploaded_at` descending.
   - If the app uses a different naming scheme, adapt accordingly.
   - Ensure this ordering is applied only to the All Documents tab, not to any dedicated “Must read” filter route that might already exist.

3. Front end display:
   - Make sure it is visually obvious which documents are must read and which are important.
   - Add clear badges or labels such as “Must read” and “Important” next to the document title.
   - Keep the styling consistent with the rest of the Purchaser portal and avoid clutter.

4. Test:
   - Seed or create documents with all three categories: must read, important, and normal.
   - Verify in the All Documents tab that:
     - All must read entries are at the very top.
     - All important entries follow.
     - All others appear after.
   - Confirm that filters like “Must read only” or “Important only” still work if they exist.

Do not alter any access control, tenant logic, or RLS policies. Only adjust the sorting and visual cues in the All Documents view.
