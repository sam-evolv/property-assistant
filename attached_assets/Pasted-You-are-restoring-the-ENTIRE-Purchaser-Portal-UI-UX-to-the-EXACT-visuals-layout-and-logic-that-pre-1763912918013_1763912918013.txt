You are restoring the ENTIRE Purchaser Portal UI/UX to the EXACT visuals, layout, and logic that previously existed and matched the design in Sam’s screenshots.

DO NOT modify, remove, or “improve” anything outside the purchaser portal.  
DO NOT touch developer dashboard, superadmin dashboard, system backend, analytics, documents pipeline, RAG backend, or any other part of the monorepo.

Your ONLY job is to *restore* the purchaser portal to the previous working design.

====================================================
RESTORE TARGET (the design to revert to):
====================================================

1. **Opening Animation**
   – Keep the new animation exactly as-is. No changes required.

2. **Home Screen (ChatGPT-style hub screen)**
   MUST look exactly like the original released version:
   – Large centred property logo icon
   – Text: “Welcome to Longview Park” (or dynamically: Welcome to {development})
   – Subtext in smaller grey: “Ask anything about your home or community.”
   – Four pill-style preloaded suggestions underneath, in two rows:
       • What heating system do I have?
       • How do I use my heat pump?
       • Where is my fuse board?
       • Show me my warranty information
   – Pills must use the gold gradient theme  
   – Background white, spacing exactly like the original  
   – No blue, no OpenStreetMap styling, no new layout elements

3. **Chat Interface (after user begins typing)**
   – Restore the EXACT bubble style you originally built:
       • Purchaser bubbles = gold gradient, rounded, left-aligned
       • Assistant bubbles = black or dark grey with white text
       • Standard chat vertical spacing
   – Restore full chat input bar:
       • White rounded input box
       • Microphone icon that activates speech-to-text
       • Gold “Send / Ask” button
   – Restore dynamic home icon top-left + language dropdown top-right
   – RAG answers must appear normally (no “error please try again” unless genuine backend error)

4. **Language Selector**
   – Restore original dropdown component  
   – Must switch languages instantly for:
       • Pills
       • Headers
       • Chat placeholder text
       • Navigation bar labels

5. **Navigation Bar (bottom)**
   MUST be restored to original layout exactly:
   – Chat
   – Map
   – Noticeboard
   – Documents
   Styling: white bar, blue-highlight icons, original spacing.

6. **Map Tab (Restore original Google Maps version)**
   – REMOVE OpenStreetMap completely
   – Restore the Google Map embed EXACTLY as before
   – Map must centre on the correct home location (lat/lng from purchaser model)
   – Restore the filter/refinements bar BELOW the map for:
       • Shopping
       • Parks
       • Schools
       • Groceries
       • Transport
       • Cafés
   – Apple Maps / Google Maps buttons should remain at the top (if previously implemented)

7. **Documents Tab**
   – Keep the NEW filtering logic (corrected version)  
   – BUT restore the OLD UI layout:
       • Grid of document cards  
       • Clean white background  
       • Simple heading “Your Documents”  
       • Each document has its filename + icon + open button  
   – House-specific drawings first  
   – General development docs second  
   – Simple section divider text, NOT accordion UI  
     (your original UI DID NOT use accordions — restore the old look)

8. **Noticeboard**
   – Restore the original Noticeboard design:
       • List of notices with card layout  
       • Blue-outline “+” floating action button for adding notices  
       • Newest-first ordering
       • Restore original font sizes, spacing, card shadow

9. **General UI / UX Theme**
   – Restore the colour theme exactly:
       • White primary background
       • Gold gradient accents
       • Black text and icons
       • Blue tab icons (bottom navbar)
   – DO NOT introduce ANY new colours, layouts, animations, icons, or design language

====================================================
IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTES
====================================================
– DO NOT rebuild the backend  
– DO NOT modify RAG  
– DO NOT change auth logic  
– DO NOT change document filtering  
– DO NOT change DB tables or API routes  
– DO NOT touch admin or developer portals  

Your job is 100% **UI/UX restoration** – nothing more.

====================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
====================================================

You will:
1. Identify all Purchaser Portal files that were modified in recent runs  
2. Revert them to match the previous working UI/UX  
3. Rewrite components only where needed to restore the exact look  
4. Ensure maps, chat, documents, noticeboard work fully again  
5. Ensure language dropdown works  
6. Ensure chat input box is restored  
7. Ensure Google Maps is reinstated  
8. Ensure pills and logo home screen restored  
9. Ensure nothing outside purchaser portal is touched

====================================================

When you begin, state:
“Restoring Purchaser Portal UI/UX to original design now.”

Then produce each file change in sequence.
