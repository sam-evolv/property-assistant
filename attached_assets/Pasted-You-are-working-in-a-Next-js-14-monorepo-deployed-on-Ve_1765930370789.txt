You are working in a Next.js 14 monorepo deployed on Vercel. The build currently fails during `next build` for `apps/unified-portal`.

There are TWO blocking issues you must fix. Apply BOTH fixes in one pass, commit, and ensure `npm ci` and `npm run build --workspace=apps/unified-portal` succeed.

## ISSUE 1 — Missing export `docChunks`

**Build error:**
Attempted import error: `docChunks` is not exported from `@openhouse/db/schema`.

### Root cause

`apps/unified-portal/app/api/information-requests/[id]/route.ts` imports `docChunks` from `@openhouse/db/schema`, but `docChunks` is not exported from the schema package.

### Required fix

1. Open `packages/db/schema.ts` (or the correct schema entry file).
2. Either:

   * Export the existing `docChunks` table if it exists but is not exported, OR
   * If the table was removed, update **all imports** to use the correct replacement table, OR
   * Remove the import and refactor usage if `docChunks` is obsolete.
3. Ensure `@openhouse/db/schema` has a valid export for whatever symbol is imported.
4. Rebuild TypeScript references if needed.

## ISSUE 2 — `/api/admin/qr-pack` fails during static build

**Build error:**

```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/admin/qr-pack
```

### Root cause

Next.js is trying to statically evaluate an API route that:

* Uses runtime-only logic (filesystem, env secrets, crypto, DB access, etc.)
* Does not explicitly opt out of static rendering

### Required fix

1. Open:

```
apps/unified-portal/app/api/admin/qr-pack/route.ts
```

2. At the TOP of the file, add:

```ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

3. Ensure:

   * No code in this route executes at module scope that depends on runtime-only values
   * All logic runs inside the request handler

This explicitly tells Next.js **not** to statically analyze this route during build.

## FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After applying both fixes:

* Run `npm ci` from repo root
* Run `npm run build --workspace=apps/unified-portal`
* Confirm:

  * No missing export errors
  * No `Failed to collect page data` errors
  * Build completes successfully

Commit all changes with a clear message (e.g. `fix: resolve schema export and force dynamic api route`).

Do not skip any step.
