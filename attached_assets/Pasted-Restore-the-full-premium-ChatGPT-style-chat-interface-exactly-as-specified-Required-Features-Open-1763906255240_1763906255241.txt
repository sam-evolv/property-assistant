Restore the full premium ChatGPT-style chat interface exactly as specified:

Required Features

Opening animation remains untouched – do NOT remove or modify it.

After the animation, the Chat tab must load the ChatGPT-style home screen:

Logo centered

“Welcome to Longview Park” (or dynamic development name)

Subtitle: “Ask anything about your home.”

Four preloaded quick questions in pill-buttons (same styling used originally):

“Where is my heat pump?”

“How does my ventilation system work?”

“What documents are available?”

“What do I do if something goes wrong?”

The chat bubbles, input bar, spacing, colours, fonts must follow the black / white / gold premium theme.

Microphone dictation must work using the Web Speech API.

DO NOT request the user’s address.
Use the already-known unitUid and the units row from Supabase.

The chat must generate correct answers using:

Property documents for that house

House type (BD02 etc.)

Global documents

Purchase info

The chat must greet the purchaser with:

“Good evening Lucy Crowley, welcome to Longview Park. How can I help with your home at 33 Longview Park, Ballyhooly Road, Ballyvolane, Cork City?”

Fixes Required

Remove the blue/white theme entirely.

Remove the blank chat screen shown in the screenshot.

Reinstate the intended ChatGPT layout exactly as previously implemented.

PHASE 7.2 — Maps Tab (Google Maps ONLY, Auto-Location, Correct Address)

Replace the current OpenStreetMap implementation and restore what was originally designed:

Required Behaviour

Use Google Maps JavaScript API (key already present).

Automatically centre the map on the homeowner’s exact coordinates:

Use units.latitude and units.longitude

If coordinates are missing, geocode the full_address.

UI must match the original design:

White card background

Gold “Open in Google Maps” button

White “Open in Apple Maps” button

Clean iconography

No placeholder pins, no incorrect addresses.

Remove the lazy / generic text. Replace with:

“Find Your Property”

“Get directions and view nearby amenities.”

PHASE 7.3 — Documents Tab (Correct Filtering Logic)

Restore the correct logic so each user sees documents for their own house + global development documents.

Document Rules

Show:

House-type-specific documents

E.g., if the purchaser lives in BD02:
show BD02 drawings, manuals, specs.

Global development documents

Fire Safety

BER

Mechanical/Electrical

Handover Pack

etc.

Do NOT show other house types’ files.

Fixes Required

The current system is not pulling documents correctly.

Rebuild the filtering using:

documents.house_type_uid

documents.is_global

units.house_type_uid

UI must return to premium design (gold headers, clean spacing).

PHASE 7.4 — Notices Tab (Plus Button + Correct UI)

Restore the Notices screen to its proper functionality.

Required Features

A gold floating + button for purchasers to submit notices.

Correct list styling (cards, spacing, timestamps, icons).

Ability to view notices from the developer (read-only).

Multi-language support.

No regressions in layout.

PHASE 7.5 — Language Switching (Dropdown + Runtime Translations)

Fix the language selector completely.

Required Behaviour

Add a language dropdown (not a dead icon).

Runtime translations for all string-based UI elements:

Chat tab

Maps tab

Notices

Documents

Navbar

Buttons

Persist the selected language in localStorage.

Dropdown placed in top-right of the Chat tab (as originally designed).

Default: English.
