You are fixing incorrect data binding and UI presentation
in the Purchaser Portal → My Home profile modal.

DO NOT redesign.
DO NOT refactor unrelated logic.
ONLY correct data source + display composition.

====================================
PROBLEMS TO FIX (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
====================================

Unit: BS06
Scheme: Rathard Park
Location: Laherdan, Ballymoulin, Cork City

Correct facts:
- Bedrooms: 3
- Bathrooms: 3
- Development name must NOT be generic
- Address must be explicit and human-readable

====================================
PART 1 — FIX DATA SOURCE (CRITICAL)
====================================

Current issue:
- Bedrooms / bathrooms are incorrect
- Development label is generic ("Development")

Cause:
- My Home card is NOT pulling from unit record
- Likely using:
  - hardcoded defaults
  - scheme-level fallback
  - incomplete house-type metadata

FIX:
- My Home must derive values in this order:

1️⃣ Unit record (highest priority)
   - unit.bedrooms
   - unit.bathrooms
   - unit.house_type_code

2️⃣ Scheme record (for address only)
   - scheme.name
   - scheme.locality
   - scheme.city
   - scheme.county

DO NOT infer counts from house type text.

FILES:
- api/purchaser/unit.ts
- api/purchaser/home.ts
- services/unitResolver.ts

ACCEPTANCE:
- BS06 shows 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms
- No hardcoded values remain

====================================
PART 2 — FIX DEVELOPMENT NAME + ADDRESS
====================================

Replace this:
"Development"

With:
"Rathard Park, Laherdan, Ballymoulin, Cork City"

UI RULES:
- Line 1 (bold):
  Welcome, Longview Estates

- Line 2 (subtle / muted):
  Rathard Park, Laherdan, Ballymoulin, Cork City

FILES:
- components/MyHomeModal.tsx
- components/MyHomeHeader.tsx

ACCEPTANCE:
- Address always reflects scheme location
- No placeholders or generic labels

====================================
PART 3 — UI CONSISTENCY GUARARDS
====================================

Add safeguards:
- If bedrooms/bathrooms missing → display "—"
- NEVER guess or default to 2
- NEVER show "Development" as a label

FILES:
- components/MyHomeStats.tsx

====================================
DELIVERABLE
====================================

- Correct My Home card for BS06
- Confirm data is pulled from unit record
- List files modified
- Confirm no other areas affected
