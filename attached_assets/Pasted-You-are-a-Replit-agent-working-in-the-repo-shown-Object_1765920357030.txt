You are a Replit agent working in the repo shown. Objective: make the Vercel production deployment succeed for the **apps/unified-portal** Next.js app. Current Vercel build failure shows: **Module not found: Can't resolve 'lucide-react'** in:

* ./app/admin-enterprise/overview-client.tsx
* ./app/admin-enterprise/rag/rag-client.tsx

Non-goals:

* Do not add or reintroduce any `vercel.json` rootDirectory config. Root Directory is configured in Vercel UI as `apps/unified-portal`.
* Do not refactor features. Focus on deploy-blocking fixes only.

Constraints:

* Use Node 20 compatibility.
* Prefer minimal diffs; keep changes localized.
* Ensure the fix is committed so Vercel can redeploy from a fresh commit.

Plan of attack (execute in order):

1. Dependency remediation (primary blocker)

* Open `apps/unified-portal/package.json`.
* Add `lucide-react` to **dependencies** (not devDependencies). Use a stable version compatible with React 18 and Next 14 (e.g., `"lucide-react": "^0.4xx.x"`; pick the latest reasonable major that is commonly used, but do not over-optimize).
* Verify no conflicting dependency aliases exist.

2. Install + lockfile hygiene

* Determine the package manager used by the repo (check for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, and root `package.json` workspaces).
* Run install using the repo’s actual package manager at the repo root so workspace resolution is correct.
* Ensure the correct lockfile is updated and included in the commit.
* Do not introduce a second lockfile type.

3. Local build verification (must pass)

* From repo root, run the build targeting the Vercel root directory:

  * Either `cd apps/unified-portal && npm run build` (or equivalent for pnpm/yarn),
  * Or run the workspace-scoped build command if the repo is configured that way.
* If additional “module not found” errors appear, repeat Step 1 for each missing package until build succeeds (keep it minimal; only add what is required for compile/build).
* If TypeScript/build failures occur, fix only what is required to compile; avoid broad refactors.

4. Vercel alignment checks (do not change Vercel UI, just ensure repo matches)

* Confirm `apps/unified-portal` has a valid Next.js structure and `next build` is the build command.
* Ensure no `rootDirectory` property exists inside any `vercel.json` (ideally none exists at all).
* Ensure the app does not rely on local-only env vars to compile (runtime env vars are fine; compile-time NEXT_PUBLIC vars must exist only if code requires them at build time).

5. Deliverables

* Provide a concise summary of what changed (files + rationale).
* Provide the exact git commands to run (stage/commit/push) and a recommended commit message.
* Provide confirmation that `next build` succeeds for `apps/unified-portal`.

Acceptance criteria (definition of done):

* `apps/unified-portal` builds cleanly with `next build` locally in Replit.
* A fresh commit is pushed to `main`.
* Vercel build no longer fails on missing `lucide-react` (and no new missing-module errors remain).

Execute now.
