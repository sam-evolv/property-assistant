You are restoring the Purchaser Portal of OpenHouse AI to the premium, original, ChatGPT-style UI/UX design.
The current UI is incorrect, broken, and inconsistent with the global design system.
Perform a complete architectural and visual reset.
Implement all instructions below exactly and in full.

SECTION 1 — Global Reset to Original Premium UI
1.1 Remove ALL temporary/minimal styles

– Remove blue/white temporary theme
– Remove OpenStreetMap implementation
– Remove minimal chat bubbles
– Remove stripped-back headers, footers, tab-bars
– Remove placeholder behaviour (wrong addresses, missing data, wrong flows)

1.2 Reinstate original premium design language across Purchaser Portal

Theme:
– Black, white, gold accents
– Consistent typography
– Clean spacing, rounded corners, premium layout
– Smooth transitions, not abrupt UI switching

Navigation:
– Restore original bottom navigation bar
– Correct icons, correct sizes
– Active tab highlighted in gold
– Inactive tabs in premium grayscale

Header:
– White header with gold icon
– Correct development name
– No gradients unless originally designed

SECTION 2 — Restore ChatGPT-Style Chat Home Screen

You must rebuild the Purchaser Chat tab to match the original design:

2.1 Chat Home Screen Requirements

When user opens Chat tab, display:

Top logo (OpenHouse AI round icon)
Centered, premium sizing.

Primary welcome message:
“Welcome to Longview Park”
or
“Welcome to your Smart Home Assistant”

Sub-text:
“Ask anything about your home and we’ll assist instantly.”

Four quick-action prompt buttons:
– “What documents do I have?”
– “What is included in my home?”
– “How do I operate my heating system?”
– “Show me information about my appliances.”

These MUST be clickable and must send correct prompts to the AI.

2.2 Chat Features to restore

– Microphone dictation button
– Language selector (actual dropdown, functioning)
– Proper input field styling
– White AI responses with soft shadow
– Gold user messages
– Smooth auto-scroll
– No duplicate messages
– No “message is required” errors
– Full RAG dataset access

2.3 AI Behaviour Fixes

AI must:

– Never ask “What is your address?” (you already know the unit)
– Always load the correct unit name, type, docs, and details
– Respond with full context: house type, drawings, manuals, local data
– Use correct system instructions for the development

SECTION 3 — Full Google Maps Integration (restore original)

Replace OpenStreetMap entirely.

3.1 Use Google Maps JS SDK

– Use dynamic import to avoid SSR issues
– Load map automatically
– Center map on the exact unit latitude/longitude
– Place premium gold pin
– Popup showing:
– Address
– Unit type
– Quick links (Open in Google Maps, Street View)

3.2 Fix coordinate sourcing

– Use unit.latitude / unit.longitude from DB
– If missing, use development-level lat/lng
– No hardcoded Cork coordinates ever

SECTION 4 — Notices Tab (Fix + Restore)
4.1 Restore full functionality

– List all notices for development
– Show date, title, content
– Style in premium card format
– Add + button to create new notices

4.2 Add Notice Form

– Title
– Body
– Optional file attachment
– CreatedBy default to “Developer”

SECTION 5 — Documents Tab (Correct Logic)
5.1 Only show documents relevant to that user’s unit

Document filtering rules:

House Type–Specific Docs
If user has BD02 → only show BD02-specific:
– BD02 drawings
– BD02 layout
– BD02 elevations

Universal Development Docs
Show docs marked “global”:
– Appliance manuals

– Handover pack
