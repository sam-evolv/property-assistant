Implement PROACTIVE NEXT BEST ACTION suggestions at the end of assistant responses.

Goal:
End most responses with 1-2 helpful follow-ons that the assistant can actually fulfil next, based on intent and available data. Never suggest actions the system cannot support.

Constraints:
- Must be disabled for emergencies and safety intercept responses.
- Must not produce dead-end follow-ups.
- Must respect feature flags.
- No spammy tone, keep it crisp.

Implementation Plan:
1) Add feature flag:
   ASSISTANT_NEXT_BEST_ACTION=true

2) Build a deterministic capability map:
   /lib/assistant/capability-map.ts

Example structure:
capabilityMap = {
  heating: {
    requires: ["docs:heating", "scheme_data:heating_type?"],
    suggestions: [
      "If you tell me which room or zone is affected, I can point you to the exact control settings.",
      "If you share your unit code, I can pull the correct heating manual section."
    ]
  },
  snagging: { ... },
  amenities: {
    requires: ["scheme_location", "places_api"],
    suggestions: [
      "If you tell me what you're looking for (pubs, cafes, gyms), I can list the closest options.",
      "Want places that are walkable, or is a short drive fine?"
    ]
  }
}

3) Add a suggestion gate:
   shouldSuggest(intent, context) returns true only if all required capabilities are met.
   Example:
   - For amenities, require scheme_location.present AND places_api working.
   - If missing, do not suggest amenity follow-ups.

4) Add yes-intent routing integration:
   If the assistant asks a follow-up question, store last_followup_topic into session memory.
   If the user replies "yes / sure / please", route to that follow-up handler.

5) Formatting:
   - Append a "Next:" line with 1-2 suggestions.
   - Keep it short, no bullets if it looks messy, or use clean bullets if consistent.

6) Tests:
   - Emergency queries must never contain suggestions.
   - Amenity suggestions must not appear when location is missing or Places fails.

Deliverables:
- /lib/assistant/capability-map.ts
- /lib/assistant/next-best-action.ts (gate + render)
- integration into assistant response composer
- tests in /tests/assistant
