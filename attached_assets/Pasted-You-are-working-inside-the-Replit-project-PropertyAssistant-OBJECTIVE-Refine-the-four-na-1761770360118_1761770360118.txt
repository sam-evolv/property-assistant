## OBJECTIVE
Refine the four navigation buttons (Chat, Map, Noticeboard, Documents) that appear below the search bar on the homepage.  
The current buttons look too large and basic — we need to make them smaller, sleeker, and premium in appearance.  
They should feel elegant, balanced, and aligned with the Lovable-style Seaview homepage (Apple-like clarity and restraint).

## TASKS

1. ✅ **Update navigation buttons section in `app/page.tsx`**
   - Replace the existing block of four large navigation cards with this cleaner, smaller version:

   ```tsx
   {/* Refined Navigation Buttons */}
   <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-6 w-full max-w-md mt-4">
     {[
       { name: "Chat", icon: "💬", href: "/chat" },
       { name: "Map", icon: "🗺️", href: "/map" },
       { name: "Noticeboard", icon: "📢", href: "/noticeboard" },
       { name: "Documents", icon: "📄", href: "/documents" },
     ].map((item) => (
       <a
         key={item.name}
         href={item.href}
         className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-20 h-20 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-xl shadow-[0_1px_4px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)] hover:border-blue-300 hover:shadow-[0_3px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.08)] transition-all duration-200 group"
       >
         <span className="text-xl mb-1 group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform">{item.icon}</span>
         <span className="text-xs font-medium text-gray-600 group-hover:text-blue-600">
           {item.name}
         </span>
       </a>
     ))}
   </div>
✨ This layout is tighter, more balanced, and has a subtle hover lift effect.

✅ Optional — Upgrade icons to premium SVGs

Install Heroicons:

bash
Copy code
npm install @heroicons/react
Replace emoji icons with outline-style SVGs for a cleaner, professional look:

tsx
Copy code
import {
  ChatBubbleLeftEllipsisIcon,
  MapIcon,
  MegaphoneIcon,
  DocumentTextIcon,
} from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";

const navItems = [
  { name: "Chat", icon: <ChatBubbleLeftEllipsisIcon className="h-5 w-5" />, href: "/chat" },
  { name: "Map", icon: <MapIcon className="h-5 w-5" />, href: "/map" },
  { name: "Noticeboard", icon: <MegaphoneIcon className="h-5 w-5" />, href: "/noticeboard" },
  { name: "Documents", icon: <DocumentTextIcon className="h-5 w-5" />, href: "/documents" },
];
And then map through navItems the same way.

✅ Refine spacing & responsiveness

Keep the navigation centered directly below the search bar.

Maintain consistent spacing:

24px gap from search bar

20px between buttons

On mobile (max-width: 640px), wrap to two rows of two buttons each.

Add this utility rule for mobile:

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .nav-card {
    width: 42%;
    height: 80px;
  }
}
Add nav-card to each <a> if using this rule.

✅ Refine shadows and hover tone

Use very light, translucent shadows:

Default: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)

Hover: 0 3px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

Hover border color: #93C5FD (Tailwind blue-300).

This ensures a subtle, high-quality hover response — not a “clicky” glow.

✅ Maintain overall hierarchy

The search bar remains the primary focal point.

The navigation icons support it visually — smaller, quiet, but clearly interactive.

Ensure the buttons line up evenly on all screen sizes and remain accessible (keyboard-focusable).

✅ Accessibility

Each link must include a proper href and descriptive aria-label. Example:

tsx
Copy code
<a
  aria-label="Open Chat"
  href="/chat"
  ...
>

feat: refine homepage navigation buttons for smaller, high-quality premium design
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Buttons are 30–40% smaller than before.

Layout feels elegant, with balanced spacing and subtle hover motion.

Matches the high-end aesthetic of the rest of the Lovable-style homepage.

Works responsively on mobile and desktop.

Fully accessible and visually cohesive with the page.

OPTIONAL (for an extra premium feel)
Add a soft fade-in motion when the nav buttons appear:

css
Copy code
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(10px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.nav-fade {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease forwards;
