Goal:
Eliminate false specifics in amenity answers while keeping the improved friendly tone.

Problem:
Assistant produced a confident, human-sounding answer with incorrect café name/location and made-up walking time. This must never happen.

Implement strict grounding rules for location/amenities (cafes, pubs, restaurants, schools, supermarkets, parks, pharmacies, gyms, etc.):

1) Hard rule: No invented specifics
- The assistant must NEVER output:
  - a venue name
  - an address/suburb/shopping centre claim
  - an opening status
  - a walk/drive time or distance
unless that specific datum exists in the retrieved sources:
  a) Google Places response (name/vicinity/place_id/open_now/latlng)
  b) Distance Matrix response (walk/drive duration)
  c) Uploaded scheme docs marked as "Local Amenities" / "Welcome Pack" (explicitly stated)

2) Enforce with a validator (amenity_answer_validator)
- After drafting an amenity answer, validate:
  - Every venue name mentioned must match a place_id/name returned by the Places call OR cited doc snippet.
  - Any “X-minute walk/drive” requires Distance Matrix data.
  - Any claim like “in Ballyvolane Shopping Centre” requires Places vicinity text or doc citation.
- If validation fails, auto-rewrite into a safe format:
  - Friendly intro
  - List only grounded venues from Places (name + vicinity + open_now if present)
  - No travel times if not grounded
  - Source hint line

3) Clarification logic for cafes/pubs/restaurants
- Add synonym map:
  - cafe/coffee/coffee shop -> cafe
  - pub/pint/bar -> bar
  - food/eat/restaurant -> restaurant
- Never ask “which type of amenity” for these obvious terms.
- If user asks broadly (“any nice cafes?”), return Places list and then ask a preference follow-up:
  - “More of a sit-in café, or grab-and-go?”
Only ask follow-ups that the system can answer.

4) Distance accuracy
- Remove any km or “5-minute walk” language unless Distance Matrix returns a duration.
- If Distance Matrix is not configured or fails, omit distances entirely.
- If user requests distance/time explicitly, respond:
  “I can show approximate walk/drive times when route data is available. For exact directions, Google Maps is best.”

5) Logging
- When the validator blocks invented specifics, log a gap event:
  reason=validation_failed
  intent=location_amenities
  details={blocked_claim_types:[...], poiCategory:...}

6) Tests
Add/extend test-suite cases:
- “Any cafés nearby?” must:
  - have no venue not present in Places
  - have no travel time unless Distance Matrix present
  - include sourceHint “Google Places” when Places used
- Add regression test for “Costa Coffee in Ballyvolane Shopping Centre” to ensure it never appears unless Places returns it.

Deliverables:
- amenity_answer_validator.ts
- integration into amenity response pipeline
- updated tests
- ensure tone improvements remain intact
No em dashes in user-visible text.
