You are upgrading the existing Property Assistant project at Replit to match the premium UI standard shown in the attached screenshot (PropertyAssistant - Replit.png). 

Follow these directives carefully:

1. **Objective**
   - Rebuild the front-end of the Property Assistant using the attached screenshot as the visual reference.
   - The chat interface must look identical to the screenshot and align with the design systems of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Apple, and Google.
   - Prioritise clarity, depth, subtle animation, and professional-grade polish.

2. **Project Context**
   - Stack: Next.js 14 + Tailwind + TypeScript.
   - Design system and tokens are already in `design/tokens.css`, `design/theme.ts`, and `design/motion.ts`.
   - Components live in `/components/ui` and `/components/chat`.
   - Do **not** remove existing logic or APIs (RAG, Supabase, model routing, etc.). Only upgrade visual structure and interactions.

3. **Visual Implementation Requirements**
   - Match layout and hierarchy exactly as shown in the screenshot:
     - Modern header with logo, light/dark toggle, and language selector.
     - Hero section with estate logo and name (e.g. Seaview) centered elegantly.
     - Chat conversation panel with rounded message bubbles, balanced whitespace, subtle elevation.
     - Bottom composer with rounded input, mic icon on the left, and glowing “Send” button on the right.
   - Match Apple-like micro-motion and ChatGPT-style flow:
     - Smooth fade-in and slide transitions between message states.
     - Pulsing streaming indicator (three dots) for live responses.
     - Subtle hover and focus states on all interactives.
     - Adaptive layout on mobile with bottom-anchored composer.
   - Typography:
     - Use Inter and Source Serif 4 per token config.
     - Weight, spacing, and contrast must mirror ChatGPT’s rhythm.
   - Colors:
     - Respect brand tokens derived in theme.ts (tenant-aware).
     - Neutral dark background, slightly desaturated surfaces, soft shadow depth.

4. **Accessibility & UX**
   - Keyboard navigation fully functional (tab, enter, escape).
   - `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
   - High-contrast mode compliant.
   - Input auto-expands for multiline, remains sticky at viewport bottom.

5. **Files to Modify**
   - `/app/chat/page.tsx`
   - `/components/chat/Message.tsx`
   - `/components/chat/Composer.tsx`
   - `/components/layout/Header.tsx`
   - `/design/tokens.css` (update only if visual alignment requires)
   - `/app/globals.css` (apply scrollbar, focus, and selection polish)

6. **Deliverables**
   - Fully rendered chat interface visually identical to the screenshot.
   - Pixel-perfect spacing, modern rounded surfaces, responsive breakpoints (360, 768, 1440).
   - Smooth dark/light mode transition.
   - Ready for production deployment on Replit (no broken imports or missing assets).

7. **Validation**
   - After rebuild, run `npm run dev` and open the webview.
   - Confirm the following:
       - Header renders cleanly with correct logo and toggles.
       - Chat bubbles display alternating alignment with subtle elevation.
       - Input bar glows on focus and animates the send button.
       - Dark/light theme toggle works instantly.
   - Capture and display a screenshot confirmation in console output.

8. **Additional Notes**
   - Retain current internationalisation (EN/GA) and theme provider.
   - Do not modify API endpoints, Supabase calls, or router logic.
   - Commit changes once the premium chat interface is visually verified.

Proceed now. Use Tailwind and Framer Motion to reconstruct all UI elements to the standard shown in the attached screenshot, ensuring professional-grade visual parity and responsiveness.
