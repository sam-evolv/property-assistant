I am locked out of the Developer Portal on Vercel ("Access Denied") despite being logged in. The Permission System is "systematically fucked."

We need to implement a "God Mode" bypass immediately. Execute these 3 Nuclear Actions:

### 1. MIDDLEWARE: REMOVE ALL BLOCKS FOR DEVELOPER
- **The Issue:** `middleware.ts` is intercepting `/developer` requests and rejecting them because it can't verify the role.
- **The Fix:** Open `middleware.ts`.
- **Action:**
  - Find the logic that checks `if (path.startsWith('/developer'))`.
  - **DELETE** the condition that checks for roles/metadata.
  - **INSERT** this override:
    ```typescript
    if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/developer')) {
      return NextResponse.next(); // ALWAYS ALLOW, NO QUESTIONS ASKED
    }
    ```

### 2. LAYOUT: HARDCODE EMAIL BYPASS (The "God Mode" Switch)
- **The Issue:** Even if middleware passes, the `layout.tsx` or page component might check the DB for a "developer" role and fail.
- **The Fix:** Open `apps/unified-portal/app/developer/layout.tsx`.
- **Action:**
  - Locate the permission check (e.g., `if (user.role !== 'developer')`).
  - **Add this specific bypass:**
    ```typescript
    // GOD MODE: If it's the main admin email, let them in regardless of DB role
    const ADMIN_EMAILS = ['sam@evolv.ie', 'your-email@example.com']; // REPLACE WITH YOUR EXACT LOGIN EMAIL
    if (user?.email && ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(user.email)) {
       // Bypass all checks -> Render children
    } else {
       // Keep original check for everyone else
    }
    ```

### 3. FORCE SESSION PERSISTENCE
- **The Issue:** Cookies might be dropping between the dashboard and the developer portal.
- **The Fix:** In `apps/unified-portal/lib/auth.ts` (or wherever Supabase client is created for the server), ensure `cookies` are being forwarded correctly.
- **Action:** Verify `createServerComponentClient` uses `{ cookies }` from `next/headers`.

**Goal:** When I go to `/developer`, the code MUST see my email and say "Welcome, Boss," ignoring whatever the broken role table says.
