Implement a lightweight purchaser videos count endpoint and use it to control Videos chip visibility without background fetching full videos.

SCOPE
- Add /api/purchaser/videos/count endpoint returning { hasVideos, count }.
- Update purchaser Docs category chip rendering to call count endpoint (lightweight) rather than fetching full videos just to decide visibility.
- Keep existing /api/purchaser/videos list endpoint unchanged.
- Do not touch protected archive/RAG files.

IMPLEMENTATION

1) API: /api/purchaser/videos/count
- Create apps/unified-portal/app/api/purchaser/videos/count/route.ts (or equivalent in your routing structure).
- Reuse the same purchaser auth/token validation + unitUid → development lookup used by the existing purchaser videos endpoint.
- Run a COUNT query against video_resources:
  - WHERE tenant_id = resolvedTenantId (if available)
  - AND development_id = resolvedDevelopmentId
  - AND is_active = true
- Return JSON: { hasVideos: count > 0, count }
- Add Cache-Control: private, max-age=60
- Error handling:
  - 401 if invalid token/auth
  - 404 if development resolution fails
  - Never throw raw 500 without JSON

2) Purchaser Docs UI
- Update the purchaser Docs category selector (PurchaserDocumentsTab.tsx or where chips are rendered):
  - On initial load (after purchaser context resolves), call /api/purchaser/videos/count.
  - Show Videos chip only if FEATURE_VIDEOS_PURCHASER enabled AND hasVideos true.
  - Do NOT fetch full videos unless user clicks Videos chip.
- Ensure no layout flicker:
  - Either reserve chip slot with loading shimmer and then remove if hasVideos false,
    OR delay rendering chips until count resolves (keep under 200ms if possible).
  - Choose the option that best matches current UI behavior.

3) Verification
- With videos present: Videos chip appears immediately (or after brief load) without fetching full list.
- With no videos: Videos chip never appears and no list endpoint is called.
- Clicking Videos chip fetches full /api/purchaser/videos and renders cards.
- Switching properties resets correctly.

4) Invalid Hook Call investigation (separate)
- Provide instructions in a short note:
  - reproduce in incognito with extensions disabled
  - if persists, run npm/pnpm command to detect duplicate react/react-dom and report results

DELIVERABLES
- File paths changed
- curl examples for the count endpoint
- Confirmation that list fetch only occurs when Videos tab selected
