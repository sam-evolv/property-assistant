You are the Replit Agent responsible for performing the final and most important layer across the entire OpenHouse AI platform.

Your purpose in this prompt is to unify, simplify, beautify, and polish the entire experience — technically, visually, and emotionally — so OpenHouse AI becomes a product that feels premium, obvious, calming, intuitive, and delightful for every user: super admin, developer, homeowner.

This prompt resolves all remaining loose ends across UX, UI, flow, clarity, accessibility, consistency, animations, content, onboarding narrative, branding, and interaction quality.

0. CORE PRINCIPLES — WHAT THIS PASS MUST ACHIEVE
────────────────────────────────────────

Every part of the platform must become:

1. **Instantly understandable**  
2. **Effortlessly intuitive**  
3. **Aesthetically cohesive**  
4. **Brand-perfect (white/black/gold)**  
5. **Emotionally reassuring**  
6. **Clean, quiet, and uncluttered**  
7. **Fast and fluid**  
8. **Consistent everywhere**  
9. **Friendly but professional**  
10. **Pleasing to use even for non-tech people**

You are making the product feel like Apple built a property handover system.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. UNIFY VISUAL & UX PATTERNS ACROSS BOTH PORTALS
────────────────────────────────────────

Apply consistent patterns across all screens in both portals:

- Page headers  
- Title/subtitle typography  
- Section spacing  
- Cards (shape, shadow, gold accent)  
- Buttons (black, gold, white variants)  
- Navigation (sidebar, bottom nav)  
- Tabs (gold underline animation)  
- Dialogs/modals  
- List items (documents, posts, houses)  
- Input fields & forms  

Audit every screen and align them to a single unified design language.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. ELIMINATE ALL VISUAL NOISE & REDUNDANCY
────────────────────────────────────────

Remove:

- Duplicate labels  
- Unnecessary borders  
- Busy icons  
- Extraneous text  
- Overly wordy instructions  
- Technical wording in consumer UI  
- Components that fight for attention  

Replace with:

- Clear headings  
- Smooth spacing  
- Minimal elements  
- One clear call-to-action per screen  

Simplify flows until every user instantly understands what to do.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. CREATE A BEAUTIFUL, TRUST-BUILDING ONBOARDING FLOW
────────────────────────────────────────

Homeowner onboarding must feel:

- welcoming  
- modern  
- premium  
- calming  
- easy  

Implement:

- Short, friendly copy  
- Three-step “Welcome to Your New Home” flow  
- Gold accent illustrations/icons  
- Smooth transitions  
- Clear next steps  

Developer onboarding must feel:

- powerful  
- clean  
- enterprise-ready  
- straightforward  

Implement:

- “Add Development” wizard  
- Previews before creation  
- Clear mapping between tenant → development → houses  

────────────────────────────────────────
4. ADD MICRO-ANIMATIONS & INTERACTION DELIGHT
────────────────────────────────────────

Introduce subtle but delightful microinteractions:

- gold shimmer on key buttons  
- fade/slide transitions between tabs  
- smooth chat bubble appearance  
- document upload drop-zone animation  
- elegant loading skeletons  
- hover elevation on cards  
- subtle gold glow during active states  

These must be tasteful, minimal, premium — no gimmicks.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. REWRITE ALL EMPTY STATES WITH BEAUTY & CLARITY
────────────────────────────────────────

For every list (documents, houses, chat, noticeboard), create elegant empty states:

- Clean illustrations  
- Simple copy  
- Gold accent  
- Clear next action button  

Example for documents:
“Nothing here yet — upload your first document and we’ll take care of the rest.”

────────────────────────────────────────
6. REWORK INFORMATION HIERARCHY & FLOW
────────────────────────────────────────

Reorganise content so users always see:

1. **What is this screen?**  
2. **What can I do here?**  
3. **What is the next action?**  

Ensure:

- Primary actions appear top-right or bottom-right  
- Secondary actions styled minimally  
- Page titles are strong and confident  
- Sections are grouped logically  

Developer Portal must feel structured like a premium dashboard.  
Tenant Portal must feel smooth like a native app.

────────────────────────────────────────
7. REMOVE ALL ROUGH EDGES & FRICTION
────────────────────────────────────────

Fix or improve:

- inconsistent padding  
- misaligned elements  
- broken breakpoints  
- mobile layout issues  
- text that wraps poorly  
- buttons that jump  
- icons that aren't in brand colors  
- jittery tab transitions  
- confusing labels (“Documents” vs “Training”)  

Nothing should feel sloppy or half-finished.

────────────────────────────────────────
8. BEAUTIFY THE AI ELEMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────

Chat must feel:

- intelligent  
- premium  
- friendly  
- structured  
- responsive  

Implement:

- clean dual-bubble design  
- gold highlight on AI name  
- typing indicator with gold dots  
- smooth scrolling  
- message grouping  
- readable message width  

Add friendly system messages:
“Ask me anything about your home or your estate.”

────────────────────────────────────────
9. UNIFY COPYWRITING, TONE & MESSAGING
────────────────────────────────────────

Rewrite all copy across the platform so it is:

- friendly  
- professional  
- concise  
- helpful  
- non-technical (consumer side)  
- confident (developer side)  

Remove engineering jargon.  
Remove fluff.  
Every line of text should feel intentional.

────────────────────────────────────────
10. PERFORM THE “GRAND TOUR”
────────────────────────────────────────

Travel through every screen in both portals and fix:

- spacing  
- alignment  
- colours  
- icons  
- animations  
- UX flows  
- typography  
- responsiveness  
- error states  
- empty states  
- loading states  

Do not leave a single element untouched.

This is an aesthetic and functional consistency sweep.

────────────────────────────────────────
