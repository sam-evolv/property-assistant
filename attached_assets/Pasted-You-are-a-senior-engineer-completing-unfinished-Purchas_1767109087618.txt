You are a senior engineer completing unfinished Purchaser Portal wiring.
Do NOT refactor working document logic.
Do NOT change schema or architecture.
Fix ONLY the remaining broken bindings.

====================================
CONTEXT (CONFIRMED STATE)
====================================

✅ Documents now:
- Upload correctly
- Are scoped correctly to unit (e.g. BS06)
- Elevation plans are retrievable via AI (links working)

❌ Still broken:
1) Maps location is incorrect
2) No "Create Post" in Noticeboard
3) Chat cannot answer basic questions using existing documents

====================================
PART 1 — MAPS: FORCE SCHEME COORDINATES (HARD OVERRIDE)
====================================

Scheme: Rathard Park  
Coordinates (ENTRANCE — SOURCE OF TRUTH):
- latitude: 51.928542
- longitude: -8.446790

ACTION:
- Hard-bind scheme geo for Rathard Park
- Do NOT fall back to:
  - purchaser address
  - browser location
  - developer defaults

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Store coordinates on scheme record if not already present
- Map component must ONLY use scheme.latitude / scheme.longitude

FILES:
- api/schemes/get.ts
- api/purchaser/map.ts
- components/PurchaserMap.tsx

ACCEPTANCE:
- Map centres exactly on 51.928542, -8.446790
- No Wicklow / Dublin fallback under any condition

====================================
PART 2 — NOTICEBOARD: ENABLE CREATE POST (PURCHASER)
====================================

Problem:
- Noticeboard exists
- Read-only
- No post creation entry point

FIX:
- Add "Create Post" button for purchaser role
- Modal or inline composer is acceptable
- Required fields:
  - title
  - body
- Optional:
  - unit_uid (auto-filled if available)

POST must save:
- scheme_id (required)
- author_role = "purchaser"
- author_unit_uid (if exists)

FILES:
- components/Noticeboard.tsx
- components/CreatePostModal.tsx (or inline)
- api/noticeboard/create.ts

ACCEPTANCE:
- Purchaser can create a post
- Post appears immediately in list
- Post is visible to other purchasers in same scheme

====================================
PART 3 — CHAT: COMPLETE BASIC DOCUMENT Q&A
====================================

Chat must now handle these MINIMUM queries:

1) "What size is my living room?"
2) "Can you give me a link to my floor plans?"
3) "Can you give me a link to my elevation plans?"

Current state:
- Elevation plan links work
- Size-based questions fail silently

FIX:
- If architectural document exists for unit:
  - Attempt answer using extracted text
  - If dimensions are NOT extractable:
    → Respond explicitly:
      "The drawings do not clearly specify dimensions for that room."

DO NOT:
- Return "I don't have that information" if documents exist
- Fail silently

FILES:
- api/chat/purchaser.ts
- services/documentContextBuilder.ts
- services/answerGuard.ts

ACCEPTANCE:
- Chat always responds with:
  - an answer OR
  - a clear explanation of why it cannot extract dimensions
- Never claims documents are missing when they are present

====================================
PART 4 — NO REGRESSIONS (IMPORTANT)
====================================

Do NOT modify:
- Smart Archive upload logic
- Unit document scoping (this is now correct)
- Elevation plan retrieval (already working)

====================================
DELIVERABLE
====================================

Implement fixes.
Confirm:
- Map centres correctly
- Create Post works
- Chat answers or explains limitations
List:
- Files changed
- Exact logic used for chat fallback responses
