Harden tenant ownership enforcement for /developer/api/places-health and ensure no scheme enumeration is possible.

CURRENT STATE
Endpoint uses Supabase service role. Tenant checks are done in code.

GOALS
- Developers can only access schemes owned by their tenant/org
- No scheme existence enumeration (do not reveal whether a schemeId exists outside tenant)
- Ensure all lookup modes (schemeId, schemeName, fallback queries) are tenant-safe
- Ensure cache/doc lookups are scheme-scoped and tenant-scoped

CHANGES REQUIRED

1) Normalize scheme access rule
- Implement a shared helper: assertSchemeAccess({schemeId?, schemeName?}, {tenant_id, role})
- Must resolve scheme ONLY through a tenant-scoped query.
- Never query scheme_profile directly without tenant constraint.

2) Tenant-scoped scheme resolution (mandatory)
- If using projects table, require a join that guarantees tenant ownership:
  - projects.tenant_id = current tenant_id
  - projects.scheme_id = scheme_profile.id (or equivalent)
- If fallback is needed, fallback query must still enforce tenant_id:
  - by joining through projects or a scheme_tenants table (whatever exists)
- Remove any resolution path that can return scheme_profile row without a tenant join.

3) Prevent scheme enumeration
- If a developer attempts access to a scheme outside their tenant, return:
  { success:false, error:"scheme_not_found" }
- Only return "forbidden" for role mismatch, not tenant mismatch.

4) schemeName lookup hardening
- schemeName lookup allowed only in X-Test-Mode and must still be tenant-scoped.
- If multiple matches within tenant, return multiple_matches.
- If matches exist outside tenant but none inside tenant, return scheme_not_found.

5) Ensure downstream lookups remain scoped
- Cache lookup: must be keyed by resolved schemeId only (no global cache keys).
- Any document augmentation used by this endpoint must enforce schemeId and tenantId (if docs are tenant-scoped).

6) Logging hygiene
- Do not log full scheme IDs or scheme names on unauthorized or scheme_not_found responses.
- In test mode for authorized users, allow debug fields.

7) Add tests
- Unit/integration tests for:
  - dev cannot access other tenant schemeId => scheme_not_found
  - schemeName lookup cannot reveal other tenant schemeId
  - valid schemeId in same tenant returns success
  - role mismatch returns forbidden

DELIVERABLE
- Updated /developer/api/places-health with strict tenant-safe resolution, no enumeration
- Shared helper used for other developer endpoints in future (optional)
- Tests added and passing
