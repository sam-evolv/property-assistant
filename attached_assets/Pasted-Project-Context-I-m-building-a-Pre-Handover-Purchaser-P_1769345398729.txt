Project Context
I'm building a Pre-Handover Purchaser Portal - a mobile-first experience for homebuyers before their keys are handed over. This portal will be merged into our main Property Assistant app, so the design must be consistent with the existing app's premium aesthetic.
Current Location
The pre-handover portal is at:

Route: /purchaser/pre-handover
Components: apps/unified-portal/components/pre-handover/

Key files to redesign:

PreHandoverHome.tsx - Main dashboard layout
PropertyCard.tsx - Hero property card with progress
QuickActionsGrid.tsx - 4-button action grid (Timeline, Docs, FAQ, Contact)
KeyDatesCard.tsx - Calendar integration card
AskQuestionCard.tsx - AI chat entry point
BottomNav.tsx - Fixed bottom navigation
BottomSheet.tsx - Slide-up sheet component
TimelineSheet.tsx - Journey milestone timeline
DocumentsSheet.tsx - Document list
FAQSheet.tsx - FAQ accordion
ContactSheet.tsx - Contact options
CalendarSheet.tsx - Add to calendar options
SettingsSheet.tsx - Settings menu
ChatSheet.tsx - AI question input

Design System (Must Follow)
Use these OpenHouse design tokens consistently:

Quick Actions - 4-button grid opening bottom sheets
Key Dates Card - Add upcoming dates to calendar
Ask Question Card - Entry point to AI chat
Bottom Navigation - Home, Docs, Chat, More tabs

What to Improve

Make it feel more premium and polished
Better visual hierarchy
Smoother animations and micro-interactions
More consistent spacing and alignment
Better status indicators
More engaging progress visualization
Ensure it matches the Property Assistant app's dark/light aesthetic

API Endpoint
Demo data is served from: /api/purchaser/pre-handover
Output
After redesigning, I will export the updated component files and implement them in the production app via Cowork.
