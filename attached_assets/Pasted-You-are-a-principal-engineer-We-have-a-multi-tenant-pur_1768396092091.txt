You are a principal engineer. We have a multi-tenant purchaser portal with developments (Longview Park, Rathard Park, Rathard Lawn). Current production behavior (confirmed by screenshots):

- Intro screen shows "Welcome Home" twice: once as the main H1 ("Welcome Home") and again where the estate name should be (subtitle).
- Address now displays correctly (good), but the estate name does NOT.
- Inside the portal, the logo in the header and center branding are STILL Longview for Rathard Lawn / Rathard Park. This is a critical tenant branding leak.

Goal (non-negotiable)
A) Intro must render:
   - H1: "Welcome Home" (keep)
   - Subtitle: the actual estate/development name, e.g. "Rathard Lawn" or "Rathard Park" or "Longview Park" (NOT "Welcome Home", NOT "Your Development")
   - Greeting: "Hello, {firstName}"
   - Address: full formatted address (already ok, ensure stays ok)
B) Portal header/logo must render the correct logo for the unit’s development (Rathard Park/Rathard Lawn/Longview), never a global default.
C) Fix must be data-driven from DB (no hardcoded mappings). Cache keys must be tenant-aware.

PHASE 1: Find the exact rendering code and fix the intro subtitle
1) Search codebase for these strings and locate the exact Intro component(s):
   - "Welcome Home"
   - "Your Development"
   - "Hello,"
2) Identify what variable is used for the subtitle line that currently shows "Welcome Home".
3) Fix the binding so subtitle renders development name:
   - Use `development.name` (or `intro.developmentName`) from the resolved payload.
   - If development name is missing, show a safe placeholder like "" or " " (do not show "Welcome Home" again).
4) Add a guard: if subtitle equals the H1 text, don’t render it (prevents duplicates even if regression happens again).

PHASE 2: Identify why logos are stuck on Longview (root cause with proof)
5) Locate all logo render points:
   - header top-left logo
   - center logo on chat screen
   Search for <img ...logo>, "Longview", "logoUrl", "branding", "tenant".
6) Trace the data source for logoUrl:
   - Is it a static import? (e.g. import longviewLogo from ...)
   - Is it coming from a global config constant?
   - Is it coming from a store/context that persists across tenants?
   - Is it cached with a non-tenant key? (e.g. localStorage "branding" or in-memory "branding")
7) Add temporary logs (server + client) on portal load:
   - unitId / accessCode
   - developmentId
   - development.name
   - branding.logoUrl
   - any cache key used
   so we can prove what values are actually being returned and what the UI is consuming.

PHASE 3: Make branding resolution single-source-of-truth (no globals)
8) Ensure the API that powers the purchaser portal returns a single payload that includes:
   - unit (id, name fields, address fields, developmentId)
   - development (id, name)
   - branding (logoUrl) for that development
9) Update the client so ALL logo render points use ONLY that runtime `branding.logoUrl`.
   - Remove any fallback to Longview images or static default imports for tenant areas.
   - If branding.logoUrl is missing, render nothing or a neutral OpenHouse mark (not Longview).
10) Fix caching:
   - Any cache for branding must be keyed by developmentId (or tenantId + developmentId).
   - Any global store must reset when the unit/development changes.
   - If localStorage is used, version the key and namespace it (e.g. branding:v2:{developmentId}).

PHASE 4: Data integrity check (do not skip)
11) Verify DB contains correct branding records:
   - developments table has correct name for Rathard Park and Rathard Lawn
   - there is a logo_url (or linked branding asset) per development
   If missing, add a migration/seed to populate Rathard Park and Rathard Lawn logo URLs properly.

PHASE 5: Regression-proofing
12) Add a minimal test (unit/integration) for resolver:
   - Given 3 developments with 3 logos and 3 units, resolver returns correct development.name and branding.logoUrl.
13) Add a small UI assertion (component test or smoke test):
   - Intro subtitle contains development name and is not equal to "Welcome Home".
   - Header logo src equals the resolved branding.logoUrl.

Deliverables
- Implement fix for intro subtitle and logo rendering.
- Remove Longview default leakage.
- Provide a short report:
  root cause(s), what changed, how to verify (3 test units/URLs), what tests added.

Start now by locating the Intro component rendering the duplicate "Welcome Home", then locate the logo source and prove why it's Longview.
