The chat interface is "glitchy" and "floating" because its layout structure is fundamentally broken. The message list and input box are pushing each other around instead of sitting in fixed positions.

Please execute this **Layout Refactor** on the main chat component (likely `apps/unified-portal/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` or similar):

**OBJECTIVE:** Refactor the entire component into a fixed-height, three-part Flexbox structure (Header, Scrollable List, Fixed Footer).

### 1. CREATE THE OUTER FRAME
- **Action:** Wrap the entire component content in a new root `div`.
- **CSS Classes:** `className="flex flex-col h-[100dvh] overflow-hidden bg-background"`
- **Why:** `h-[100dvh]` (dynamic viewport height) is critical for mobile browsers. It locks the container to the actual visible screen height, preventing the "floating" and bouncing seen in the images.

### 2. FIX THE MESSAGE LIST (The Scrollable Area)
- **Action:** Identify the container that holds the chat bubbles.
- **CSS Classes:** Change its classes to exactly: `className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto flex flex-col-reverse p-4 space-y-4 space-y-reverse"`
- **Why:**
  - `flex-1`: Makes it take up all available space between the header and footer.
  - `overflow-y-auto`: Makes *only* this section scrollable.
  - `flex-col-reverse`: Crucial. It builds the list from the bottom up, so new messages appear at the bottom naturally, like iMessage. This prevents the "jumping" issue.

### 3. ANCHOR THE INPUT AREA (The Fixed Footer)
- **Action:** Identify the container holding the text input and send button.
- **Placement:** Ensure this container is a direct child of the root Outer Frame `div`, positioned **after** the Message List `div`. It must NOT be inside the Message List.
- **CSS Classes:** `className="flex-none w-full border-t bg-background p-4"`
- **Why:** `flex-none` prevents it from growing or shrinking. `border-t` and `bg-background` give it a solid, defined area so it doesn't look like it's floating.

### 4. PLACE THE TYPING INDICATOR
- **Action:** Ensure the "flashing type counter" component is placed **inside** the Message List `div`, as the very first item (which will appear at the bottom due to `flex-col-reverse`).
- **Why:** This makes it scroll with the messages, so it doesn't levitate over the input box.

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- Do **NOT** change any JavaScript logic, state, or API calls.
- Do **NOT** use `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` for the main layout elements, as this causes z-index wars and mobile issues. Use Flexbox as described.

**Verify:** After this change, the input box should be stuck to the bottom of the screen, and only the area above it should scroll.
