You must now enter FULL SYSTEM REPAIR MODE.

Correct the entire project so that the actual running application matches the promised output from Phases 1–5.7.

You must perform the following steps in order, without skipping any:

1. FULL CODEBASE SCAN
- Walk the entire monorepo.
- List ALL analytics-related files.
- Identify ANY analytics pages or components not mounted in the actual UI.
- Identify legacy folders producing conflicts (admin-portal, developer-dashboard, resident-app, assistant-tenant).
- Identify duplicate or unused API routes.

2. FIX ROUTING COMPLETELY
- Ensure /analytics is actually connected to the unified portal router.
- Ensure the 7 analytics tabs exist:
   Overview, Trends, Knowledge Gaps, RAG Performance, Documents, Homeowners, Units
- Ensure they render.
- Ensure navigation tabs appear in the UI.

3. FIX COMPONENT IMPORTS
- Verify that all 18 analytics components actually exist in the filesystem.
- Import them correctly.
- Delete stale or unused components.

4. FIX API ROUTES
- Ensure all 11 analytics API routes exist under the unified portal API.
- Ensure they return real data.
- Ensure the frontend fetch paths match the backend paths.
- Ensure no undefined imports.

5. FIX BACKEND → FRONTEND DATA FLOW
- Connect actual real message counts, document counts, RAG metrics, homeowner data.
- Ensure analytics cards receive correct props.
- Ensure charts load actual data.

6. REMOVE LEGACY CODE
- Delete admin-portal, developer-dashboard, resident-app, assistant-tenant.
- Remove all imports referencing deprecated folders.

7. THEME & UI FIXES
- Apply consistent black/white/gold theme.
- Apply premium design polish.
- Remove the old basic dashboard UI that is still appearing.
- Ensure analytics displays the new premium layout.

8. VALIDATION
- Launch preview at PORT=5000 and confirm:
   - The new analytics dashboard appears.
   - All tabs are visible.
   - Charts show data.
   - No console or TypeScript errors.

9. REPORT
After finishing, produce a detailed report:
- What was broken
- What was fixed
- Files created / deleted / edited
- Remaining gaps if any
