Here's the Replit prompt:

Redesign social housing unit rows in the Sales Pipeline for a premium, differentiated appearance.
Social housing units (sale_type = 'social' in unit_sales_pipeline table) follow a different process than private sales - they don't have individual purchasers, deposits, contracts, or queries. They only need Snag and Handover tracking.
Design requirements for social housing rows:

Row Background: Subtle warm grey background (#F8F7F5 or similar) to visually separate from white private sale rows - should feel premium, not "disabled"
Unit/Purchaser Column:

Show unit number and address as normal (e.g., "29 Longview Park")
Replace purchaser name with elegant "Social Housing" label in muted text
Add a refined badge: small, rounded pill with "Clúid" in a sophisticated teal or slate blue (#5B8A8A or similar) - not garish, should feel professional


Sales Process Columns (Release through Kitchen):

These columns should appear "inactive" but not broken
Show a subtle "—" in a lighter grey (#D0D0D0)
Or leave cells empty with just the muted background
No interaction/click states on these cells


Active Columns (Snag, Drawdown, Handover, Progress, Est. Close):

These remain fully functional and styled normally
Should have white or slightly lighter background to stand out from the muted row
Dates display and edit as normal


Visual Hierarchy:

The row should feel "complete but different" not "broken or empty"
When scanning the table, your eye should naturally focus on private sales while social units recede slightly but remain readable
Maintain consistent row height - don't collapse or shrink social rows


Hover State:

Subtle hover effect that's slightly different from private rows
Perhaps a gentle transition to a slightly warmer grey


Progress Column:

Social units should still show progress based on Snag/Handover completion
If both Snag and Handover are complete, show 100% green
If only Snag, show partial progress



Quality Standards:

No harsh color contrasts
Smooth transitions and hover states
Typography should remain crisp and readable
The overall effect should feel like a premium property management tool, not a basic spreadsheet
Test with the Longview Park data where units 29-32 and 67-75 are social housing
