I understand your frustration. Here's a very direct, specific prompt:

FINAL REQUEST: Change ALL Light Grey Text to Black - SPECIFIC FILES
The Problem
There is light grey text that is nearly invisible throughout the Sales Pipeline Analysis pages. This has been requested over 20 times and still isn't fixed.
Exactly What to Do
Step 1: Find all Tailwind grey text classes in these specific files/folders:
bashgrep -rn "text-gray-[234]00\|text-slate-[234]00\|text-neutral-[234]00" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" apps/
```

**Step 2: Replace them ALL:**
```
text-gray-200 → text-gray-900
text-gray-300 → text-gray-900  
text-gray-400 → text-gray-800
text-slate-200 → text-slate-900
text-slate-300 → text-slate-900
text-slate-400 → text-slate-800
Step 3: Check these SPECIFIC components (from the screenshots):

Sales Pipeline Analysis - Overview tab

"SALES FUNNEL" labels (Released, Agreed, Deposit, etc.)
"REVENUE SUMMARY" numbers
"SALES VELOCITY TREND" axis labels


Sales Pipeline Analysis - Velocity tab

"AVERAGE SALES CYCLE" stage labels
"SALES VELOCITY TREND" chart labels
"FASTEST & SLOWEST SALES" table text


Sales Pipeline Analysis - Pipeline tab

"UNITS NEEDING ATTENTION" table text
"QUERIES PERFORMANCE" labels


Sales Pipeline Analysis - Forecasting tab

"UPCOMING HANDOVERS" card numbers (40, 15, 68)
"CASH FLOW PROJECTION" chart labels and axis



Step 4: Also check for inline styles:
bashgrep -rn "color.*#[cdef]" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" apps/
grep -rn "opacity-[345]0" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" apps/
Replace any #ccc, #ddd, #eee with #1f2937 (grey-800).
Step 5: Check chart libraries:
If using Recharts:
jsx<XAxis tick={{ fill: '#1f2937' }} />
<YAxis tick={{ fill: '#1f2937' }} />
<Tooltip contentStyle={{ color: '#1f2937' }} />
If using Chart.js:
jsxoptions: {
  scales: {
    x: { ticks: { color: '#1f2937' } },
    y: { ticks: { color: '#1f2937' } }
  }
}
Expected Result
ALL text in the Sales Pipeline Analysis pages should be clearly readable - dark grey or black on white/light backgrounds. No light grey text anywhere.
Verify
After making changes, visually check each tab:

Overview ✓
Velocity ✓
Pipeline ✓
Revenue ✓
Forecasting ✓

Every piece of text must be clearly visible.
