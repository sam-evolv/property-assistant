MISSION

Transform the Resident Tenant App into a premium, intuitive, elegantly designed flagship interface that feels luxurious, fast, and human-centric.
This phase focuses exclusively on the front-end experience of the homeowner-facing app, not the developer portal.

The outcome should be:

Beautiful

Seamless

Predictable

Cohesive

Insanely intuitive

Visually consistent with the new gold/black/white OpenHouseAI identity.

The app should feel like it was built by Apple x Airbnb x Revolut.

OBJECTIVES
1. Establish a Consistent Premium Theme (Global Theming Overhaul)

Transform the resident app into a fully unified design system:

Remove all legacy colours

Apply a consistent palette:

White background (primary content layer)

Off-white cards (secondary surfaces)

Soft shadows, very subtle

Gold as primary accent

Black/charcoal for typography

Light grey dividers

Eliminate the cheap or “default React” look in every component.

Replace all chat bubbles:

Homeowner messages → white bubble with thin gold outline

Assistant messages → slate grey bubble with thin gold outline

Add tasteful radius, 12–16px

Ensure bubbles adapt to text length

Smooth animations on appearance (fade + slide).

2. Typography Upgrade

Implement the premium typography system:

“Inter” or “SF Pro Display” (if available)

Headings: weight 600 or 700

Body text: weight 400

Reduce excessive bolds

Ensure spacing is consistent everywhere

Global type scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32px

3. Navigation & Bottom Bar Polish

Rebuild the bottom navigation bar into a premium component:

Gold active icon

Black inactive icons with 70 percent opacity

Soft hover states

Smooth transition animations

Better spacing and visual separation

Remove pixel-jumps or layout shifts

4. Chat Experience Excellence

Fix and enhance:

Smooth scroll anchoring

Auto-scroll to latest message

Reduce message jitter

Add message timestamp hover

Add micro-transitions

Improve send button aesthetics (gold accent, tasteful outline)

Add a short fade-in animation to each message arrival

5. Document Download UX Upgrade

Implement document download presentation:

Whenever assistant responds with a linked document (floor plan, elevation, BER, site plan etc), show:

A premium gold-outlined card

Document icon

File size

“Download” button (rounded, gold outline)

Ensure storage URLs are correct

Add loading states and error handling

6. Map Polish

Refine the map UI:

Softer map UI components

More elegant POI marker styling

8. Micro-Interactions

Implement subtle effects:

Fade transitions

Soft hover states

Button press animation

Card elevation on hover

Smooth page transitions with framer-motion

9. Performance Optimisation

Reduce unnecessary re-renders

Debounce chat input

Lazy-load heavy assets
