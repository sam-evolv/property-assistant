ROLE: You are the Replit Agent inside the PropertyAssistant repo. Your task is to refine and elevate the existing Developer Login page to a premium, brand-accurate OpenHouse AI experience. The current implementation is directionally correct but visually underwhelming and brand-inaccurate. Fix this properly.

CRITICAL CORRECTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1) LOGO – MUST USE THE CORRECT ASSET
- Replace the placeholder / incorrect logo with the provided official OpenHouse AI gold logo.
- Asset to use: OpenHouseAi Logo.png (provided by user).
- Place it prominently ABOVE “Developer Login”, centred.
- Size: visually dominant but restrained (approx 72–96px height on desktop).
- Do NOT raster-blur or recolour the logo. Preserve its gold integrity.

2) LOGO ANIMATION – SUBTLE, PREMIUM
- Add a **slow “breathing” glow effect** to the logo:
  - Very subtle scale pulse (e.g. 1.0 → 1.03 → 1.0 over ~6–8s).
  - Soft gold radial glow that gently fades in/out.
  - No gimmicks. No bounce. No rotation.
- Use CSS-only animation (keyframes), GPU-friendly.
- Effect should read as “alive”, not “animated”.

3) INPUT FIELDS – REMOVE WHITE (WHITE LOOKS CHEAP)
- Replace white email/password inputs immediately.
- New input style:
  - Background: near-black / charcoal (e.g. #0E1116 / #111827 range).
  - Border: subtle gold or muted warm grey (1px).
  - Text: off-white / warm grey, NOT pure white.
  - Placeholder: low-contrast muted grey.
- Focus state:
  - Soft gold glow (box-shadow), very subtle.
  - No bright outlines.
- Rounded corners, premium spacing.

4) BACKGROUND – TOO FLAT, ADD DEPTH
- The pure black background is too dead. Add **controlled visual interest**:
  Choose ONE of the following (do not overdo):
  OPTION A (preferred):
    - Subtle radial gradient behind the card (dark → slightly warmer black).
    - Very faint gold noise/grain overlay (2–4% opacity).
  OPTION B:
    - Elegant vertical “data rain” / particle streaks in gold/white at extremely low opacity (inspired by the provided image).
    - Must be slow, barely noticeable, and non-distracting.
- Performance matters. No video backgrounds.

5) CARD ITSELF – MORE LUXURY
- Current card is acceptable but can be improved:
  - Slightly softer shadow.
  - Very subtle inner gradient (top slightly lighter than bottom).
  - Border: hairline, semi-transparent, warm tone.
- Increase vertical breathing room slightly.

6) TYPOGRAPHY & COPY
- “Developer Login” stays.
- Subheading (“Access your developer portal”) should be smaller and calmer.
- Ensure font weights feel deliberate and confident.
- No pure white text except headline if needed; prefer off-white.

7) BUTTONS
- Primary “Sign In” button:
  - Gold gradient (subtle, not flashy).
  - Hover: slight lift + glow.
  - Active: press-in feel.
- Secondary links (“Forgot password?”, “Create one”):
  - Muted gold text.
  - No underline by default; underline or brighten on hover.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- This is a refinement, not a rebuild. Modify the existing login page.
- Keep routing, auth logic, and form handling exactly as-is.
- Focus only on:
  - Correct logo usage
  - Visual polish
  - Brand fidelity
- Ensure mobile still looks excellent (logo slightly smaller, card full-width).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (VERY IMPORTANT)

The page should feel:
- On the same tier as the OpenHouse AI marketing homepage.
- Confident, calm, and expensive.
- Like something a Tier-1 property developer would trust.

If it looks like a generic SaaS login, it has FAILED.

START NOW:
1) Swap in the correct logo asset.
2) Remove white from inputs.
3) Add logo breathing glow.
4) Add subtle background depth.
5) Polish spacing, shadows, and finishes.

Do not ship halfway.
