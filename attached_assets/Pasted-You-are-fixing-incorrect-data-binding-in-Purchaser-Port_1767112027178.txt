You are fixing incorrect data binding in Purchaser Portal → My Home modal.
DO NOT hardcode addresses or stats.
DO NOT change styling beyond what’s required to display correct values.
Goal: everything comes from Supabase tables (scheme + unit), with safe fallbacks.

========================================
CURRENT BUGS (CONFIRMED)
========================================
1) Address is wrong and appears hardcoded:
   Needs to be exactly:
   "Rathard Park, Lahardane, Ballyvolane, Cork City"

2) Address is being placed incorrectly:
   Under "Welcome, Longview Estates" the subline shows "25"
   It must show the full address string (above), sourced from Supabase.

3) Bedrooms & Bathrooms are now showing “-” (null/undefined)
   Must show: 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms for this unit (BS06).

4) Development card shows scheme name and partial locality, but must use the scheme’s full address fields.

========================================
SOURCE OF TRUTH (DO NOT HARDCODE)
========================================
Supabase tables already contain this from the uploaded spreadsheet:
- schemes (or developments) table:
    id, name, address_line_1, address_line_2, locality, city, county, eircode, lat, lng, etc.
- units table:
    id, scheme_id, house_type_code, bedrooms, bathrooms, address_line_1, etc.

Rules:
- Welcome header subline = Scheme full address string (derived from scheme record)
- Development block = scheme.name + same scheme address string
- Bedrooms/Bathrooms = unit.bedrooms / unit.bathrooms (not inferred from house type)

========================================
STEP 1 — IDENTIFY EXACT TABLES + FIELDS
========================================
Search codebase for:
- Supabase query that powers My Home modal
- Any hardcoded address strings
- Any placeholders showing “25”
Files likely:
- components/purchaser/MyHomeModal.tsx
- components/purchaser/MyHomeHeader.tsx
- components/purchaser/MyHomeStats.tsx
- app/purchaser/(routes)/homeowners/[id]/page.tsx
- lib/supabase/queries/*.ts
- services/purchaserHome.ts
- api/purchaser/home.ts

Also search for:
- "Welcome, Longview Estates"
- "DEVELOPMENT"
- "25"
- "Rathard"
- "address"
- "bedrooms"
- "bathrooms"

========================================
STEP 2 — FIX QUERY TO RETURN SCHEME + UNIT
========================================
Ensure the backend returns a single payload that includes:
- unit: { id, scheme_id, house_type_code, bedrooms, bathrooms, ... }
- scheme: { id, name, address fields... }

If the current API only returns unit, extend it to join scheme:
- Supabase join:
   units -> schemes on scheme_id
OR two queries in one handler.

Acceptance:
- For a unit in Rathard Park, payload includes correct scheme fields.
- Bedrooms/bathrooms are present (not null). If null in DB, that is a data issue; log it loudly.

========================================
STEP 3 — ADDRESS COMPOSITION (NO HARDCODE)
========================================
Implement a single helper:
formatSchemeAddress(scheme) -> string

Priority (use whichever fields exist in DB):
- scheme.name (NOT included in address string for the header subline unless specified)
- scheme.address_line_1 (optional)
- scheme.address_line_2 (optional)
- scheme.locality (Lahardane)
- scheme.city (Ballyvolane OR Cork City depending on schema)
- scheme.county (optional)
- If there is a single “full_address” field in DB, use that directly.

Required output for Rathard Park MUST render as:
"Rathard Park, Lahardane, Ballyvolane, Cork City"

If the DB stores:
- scheme.name = "Rathard Park"
- locality = "Lahardane"
- area/suburb = "Ballyvolane"
- city = "Cork City"
Then format exactly in that order:
`${name}, ${locality}, ${area}, ${city}`

Do NOT invent spellings.
Do NOT fallback to Cork unless in DB.

========================================
STEP 4 — FIX THE “25” HEADER SUBLINE
========================================
Currently the subline under welcome shows “25”.
That’s wrong and indicates a wrong field binding (maybe unit number / purchaser id / bedrooms count).

Replace it:
- Under the Welcome title show the scheme address string from formatSchemeAddress(scheme)
- Remove any leftover numeric placeholder

========================================
STEP 5 — FIX BEDROOMS/BATHROOMS DISPLAY
========================================
Currently showing “-” due to undefined.

Implement strict display rules:
- If unit.bedrooms is a number: show it
- Else show "—" (em dash) AND console.warn with unit id and scheme id
Same for bathrooms.

DO NOT default to 2.
DO NOT infer from house type.
DO NOT show "-" (dash). Use "—" only as missing indicator.

========================================
STEP 6 — VERIFY DATA EXISTS IN SUPABASE
========================================
Add a temporary debug log in dev only:
- log the unit payload returned by API
- log the scheme payload returned by API
Remove noisy logs after verifying.

========================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================
1) My Home modal shows:
   - Bedrooms: 3
   - Bathrooms: 3
   - Development: Rathard Park
   - Development address: "Rathard Park, Lahardane, Ballyvolane, Cork City"
   - Header subline under "Welcome, Longview Estates": same address string (NOT "25")

2) No hardcoded address strings anywhere in components for this modal.

3) Provide list of modified files and a short explanation of what was wrong (wrong binding + missing join).

========================================
NON-NEGOTIABLE ACCEPTANCE TESTS
========================================
- Switch between Longview Park and Rathard Park:
  Address and stats change correctly per scheme/unit.
- Refresh page:
  Values persist (not reverting).
- No “25” appears anywhere in the My Home header.
