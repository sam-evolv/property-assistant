I've created 5 files. Here's the Replit Prompt to integrate these plus fix the remaining issues:

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT: Super Admin Dashboard Overhaul
Files to Integrate
I've created the following files that need to be integrated:
1. Onboarding Submissions Page

File: super-onboarding-submissions-page.tsx
Location: /app/super/onboarding-submissions/page.tsx
Purpose: View and manage questionnaire submissions from new developers

2. Tenants/Developers Management Page

File: super-tenants-page.tsx
Location: /app/super/tenants/page.tsx
Purpose: Create and manage developer companies (tenants)

3. API Routes

api-super-onboarding-submissions-route.ts → /app/api/super/onboarding-submissions/route.ts
api-super-onboarding-submissions-id-route.ts → /app/api/super/onboarding-submissions/[id]/route.ts
api-super-tenants-route.ts → /app/api/super/tenants/route.ts

Sidebar Navigation Updates
Add to super admin sidebar:

"Tenants" → /super/tenants (under MANAGEMENT section)
"Onboarding Submissions" → /super/onboarding-submissions (under MANAGEMENT section)

Critical Bugs to Fix
1. Developers page API broken

/super/developers shows "Failed to Load - API may not be available"
Fix the /api/super/developers endpoint or merge with /api/super/tenants

2. Developments page showing 0

/super/developments shows "No developments yet" but Longview Park has 75 units
The query is likely filtering by wrong project/tenant context
Should show ALL developments across ALL tenants for super admin

3. Add "status" column to onboarding_submissions table
sqlALTER TABLE onboarding_submissions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';
New Project Flow Enhancement
The existing "New Project" wizard (Details → Upload → Review → Complete) needs:

Tenant selection dropdown at the start - "Which developer is this for?"
If creating for a new developer, option to create tenant inline
After creating development, link it to the selected tenant_id

Database Schema Check
Ensure onboarding_submissions table has these columns:

id, tenant_id, developer_id, developer_email
development_name, development_address, county
estimated_units, expected_handover_date
planning_reference, planning_pack_url
master_spreadsheet_url, supporting_documents_urls
notes, status (pending/in_review/completed/rejected)
created_at, updated_at

Design Requirements
All new pages must follow OpenHouse design system:

Gold accents: #D4AF37
Lucide icons only (no emojis)
Card style: bg-white border border-gold-100 rounded-lg shadow-sm
Button style: bg-brand-500 text-white hover:bg-brand-600
Font: Inter
Transitions: transition-all duration-150
