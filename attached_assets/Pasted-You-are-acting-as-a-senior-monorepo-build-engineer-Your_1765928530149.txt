You are acting as a senior monorepo build engineer. Your sole objective is to make this project **successfully build and deploy on Vercel**. Runtime correctness is secondary; build correctness is mandatory.

### Context

* Monorepo using npm workspaces
* Next.js app at `apps/unified-portal`
* Shared package at `packages/api`
* Vercel build fails with webpack errors due to missing modules

### Build Errors (Authoritative)

Webpack fails because `packages/api/src/index.ts` imports **non-existent files**:

* `./documents/index`
* `./documents/classify-document`
* `./documents/map-floorplan-to-house-type`

These files **do not exist in the repository** and must NOT be referenced during a Next.js build.

---

## REQUIRED ACTIONS (DO NOT SKIP)

### 1. Open `packages/api/src/index.ts`

Locate **all exports/imports** referencing the following paths:

* `./documents`
* `./documents/index`
* `./documents/classify-document`
* `./documents/map-floorplan-to-house-type`

### 2. REMOVE OR NEUTRALIZE THOSE EXPORTS

You must do ONE of the following (preferred order):

#### ✅ Option A — DELETE the exports entirely (preferred)

If the exports look like any of the following, **delete them**:

```ts
export * from "./documents";
export * from "./documents/index";
export * from "./documents/classify-document";
export * from "./documents/map-floorplan-to-house-type";
```

or

```ts
import { classifyDocument } from "./documents/classify-document";
```

These references are invalid and block the build.

---

#### ✅ Option B — Stub them explicitly (only if needed downstream)

If other code requires these exports to exist at build time, then:

1. Create directory:

```
packages/api/src/documents/
```

2. Create the following files with **minimal stubs**:

**`packages/api/src/documents/index.ts`**

```ts
export {};
```

**`packages/api/src/documents/classify-document.ts`**

```ts
export function classifyDocument() {
  throw new Error("classifyDocument is not implemented");
}
```

**`packages/api/src/documents/map-floorplan-to-house-type.ts`**

```ts
export function mapFloorplanToHouseType() {
  throw new Error("mapFloorplanToHouseType is not implemented");
}
```

This satisfies webpack without changing architecture.

---

### 3. Verify Import Chain

Confirm that:

* `apps/unified-portal/app/api/houses/import/route.ts`
* imports from `packages/api`
* but **does not introduce new missing imports**

If it does, apply the same strategy: **delete or stub until build passes**.

---

### 4. DO NOT:

* Change Vercel settings
* Change Next.js config
* Add experimental flags
* Guess paths
* Ignore TypeScript errors that block build

---

### 5. Final Validation Steps (Mandatory)

After changes:

1. Run locally (or simulate mentally if tooling unavailable):

```bash
npm run build --workspace=apps/unified-portal
```

2. Ensure:

* No `Module not found` errors
* No webpack fatal errors

3. Commit changes with a message similar to:

```
fix(api): remove invalid document exports blocking Next.js build
```

---

### Success Criteria

The task is complete **only when Vercel build passes**.

Do not stop early. Do not explain. Execute.
