Objective: Produce a full, Apple-ready brief covering (1) analytics collection and (2) the app’s primary purpose, written clearly enough to be reused for App Store Connect, Privacy Nutrition Labels, and App Review notes.

Context you must assume

The app requires login, but not via username/password.

Access is granted via a unique identification code (one-time or assigned), used solely to identify and associate a user/session with a property, development, or portal.

The app does collect analytics.

The UI is final; iteration will primarily occur at the backend/service layer.

This is a production SaaS-style app, not a demo or content app.

Your tasks (do not skip any)
1. Define the Primary Purpose of the App (Apple-facing)

Produce:

A 1-sentence primary purpose statement (plain English, no marketing fluff).

A short paragraph (3–4 sentences) expanding on the purpose, written in a way that would pass Apple App Review scrutiny.

A “what the app does NOT do” clarification (important for review risk reduction).

This must clearly explain:

Why the app exists

Who it is for

What problem it solves

Why login via a unique code is necessary and justified

Avoid:

Vague phrases like “enhanced experience” or “smart platform”

Over-promising or future features not currently live

2. Analytics Collection – Full Disclosure Inventory

Create a structured analytics brief that includes:

A. Categories of analytics collected
Explicitly list and describe:

Usage analytics (screens viewed, feature usage)

Interaction analytics (button taps, navigation flows)

Performance analytics (latency, errors, crashes)

Device/contextual data (OS version, device type, app version)

Session-level identifiers (linked to the unique identification code, not personal identity)

B. What is NOT collected
Clearly state exclusions, for example:

No names, emails, phone numbers (unless true otherwise)

No precise location (unless explicitly used)

No contacts, photos, microphone, etc.

C. Purpose of analytics
Tie every analytics category to one of:

App stability and performance

Product improvement

Feature prioritisation

Operational insight for developers/property managers (if applicable)

D. Data linkage
Explain:

Whether analytics are linked to a user/session via the unique code

Whether they are anonymous, pseudonymous, or identifiable

Whether analytics are linked across apps or services (likely “no”)

This section must be written so it can be directly mapped into:

App Store Connect “App Privacy” questions

Internal compliance documentation

3. Login Mechanism Explanation (Reviewer-Safe)

Write a short technical explanation of:

Why login is required

Why a unique identification code is used instead of username/password

How this improves security, reduces friction, and limits personal data collection

This explanation should be suitable for:

App Review “Notes to Reviewer”

Privacy justification

4. Apple App Review Risk Check

Produce a short checklist answering:

Does this app require login? (Yes – justified)

Is login tied to core functionality? (Explain why)

Are analytics essential and proportionate? (Explain why)

Is any data used for tracking or advertising? (Explicit yes/no)

Call out any potential red flags and how they are mitigated.

5. Output Format (strict)

Your final output must be structured exactly as:

Primary Purpose (1 sentence)

Expanded Purpose (short paragraph)

What the App Does Not Do

Analytics Collected (bullet-pointed by category)

Analytics Not Collected

Purpose of Analytics

Data Linkage Explanation

Login Mechanism Justification

Apple Review Risk Notes

Use clear headings. No emojis. No marketing language. Assume this will be read by Apple reviewers and lawyers.
