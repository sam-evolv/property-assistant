The Vision: Transform the mobile web experience (< 768px) into a high-fidelity, "Native App" interface. It must feel substantial, fluid, and intentional—not just a shrunken desktop site.

Directives (Execute in Order):

PHASE 1: THE "APP SHELL" (NAVIGATION)

Target: components/Layout.tsx (and Sidebar.tsx).

Logic:

Desktop: Keep the existing Sidebar.

Mobile: HIDE Sidebar completely. RENDER a MobileTabBar component.

Component: MobileTabBar:

Position: fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-50.

Styling:

Background: bg-white/90 (Light) or bg-[#1A1A1A]/90 (Dark) with backdrop-blur-xl (Apple-style frosted glass).

Border: 1px solid top (border-white/10 or border-black/5).

Safe Area: Add padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) to account for the iPhone Home Bar.

Items: Show 4-5 core tabs (Home, Docs, Chat, Map, Profile).

Active State: When active, the icon should turn the Brand Gold color. No background pills; keep it clean.

PHASE 2: THE "NATIVE TOUCH" (INTERACTION DESIGN)

Global CSS (app/globals.css):

Disable Zoom: Ensure Input fields are at least 16px font-size to prevent iOS from zooming in when tapped.

Disable Selection: Add .no-select { user-select: none; -webkit-user-select: none; } to UI elements (buttons, navs) so they don't highlight text like a document.

Remove Tap Color: * { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; }.

Button Feel: Add an active state to all clickable cards/buttons: active:scale-95 transition-transform duration-100 (Subtle shrink effect on tap).

PHASE 3: THE "SHEET" PATTERN (MODALS)

Objective: On mobile, center modals feel clunky. We want "Bottom Sheets."

Logic:

In your Modal or Dialog component:

Desktop: Keep centered positioning (items-center justify-center).

Mobile: Change to items-end justify-center with bottom-0.

Animation: On mobile, slide up from bottom (translate-y-full -> translate-y-0).

Handle: Add a small gray "grab handle" pill at the top of the mobile sheet content.

PHASE 4: THE VIEWPORT FIX (CHAT & INPUTS)

Target: Chat Interface.

Height Logic: Replace all h-screen classes with h-[100dvh] (Dynamic Viewport Height). This fixes the "floating URL bar" issue on mobile browsers.

Sticky Inputs: Ensure the chat input bar is position: sticky to the bottom and respects env(safe-area-inset-bottom).

PHASE 5: INSTALLABILITY (PWA MANIFEST)

Create/Update public/manifest.json:

display: "standalone" (Removes browser URL bar).

background_color: "#1A1A1A" (Matches splash screen).

start_url: "/".

Meta Tags (app/layout.tsx):

<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />

<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" /> (Allows content to flow behind the notch).

PHASE 6: DATA PRESENTATION (CARDS VS TABLES)

Logic: If any tables exist (e.g., Documents List), force them to render as Cards on mobile.

Refinement: Ensure text doesn't truncate awkwardly. Use 2 lines max with line-clamp-2.
