Proceed with the remaining i18n work. Priority order is: infrastructure integrity, coverage, accuracy, then polish. Do not introduce breaking changes.

PHASE 1 - Component migrations (route-by-route, low risk)
Goal: eliminate local TRANSLATIONS objects and hard-coded strings in these components, using the global t() from the I18nProvider.

1) PurchaserChatTab
   - Replace all visible UI strings, placeholders, button labels, empty states, error messages with t("...").
   - Keep any API payload content unchanged (only UI).
   - Ensure switching language live updates the chat UI without reload.

2) NoticeboardTab
   - Translate composer UI, buttons, meta labels (“posted by”, “comments”), empty states, and error states.
   - Dynamic content (resident names, post bodies) must NOT be translated.
   - Ensure date formatting uses Intl with locale for displayed timestamps.

3) DocumentsTab
   - Translate headings, filters, status labels, buttons, empty states, error states.
   - Do NOT translate document filenames or uploaded file metadata.
   - Confirm language switch updates the tab instantly.

4) MapsTab
   - Translate UI controls, category labels, filter chips, empty states, error states.
   - Do NOT translate external POI names/addresses returned by APIs.
   - Ensure any “No results” states translate correctly across languages.

5) ProfilePanel
   - Translate field labels, sections, CTA buttons, validation copy.
   - Do NOT translate user-entered profile values.
   - Ensure “3 Bedrooms / 3 Bathrooms” renders correctly with pluralisation rules per locale (use i18n plural support, not manual logic).

Rules for all migrations
- NO hard-coded strings in JSX for user-facing UI.
- NO runtime machine translation. All strings must come from locale JSON.
- Use stable semantic keys in common.json. Do not create duplicate keys for the same concept.
- Prefer interpolation (t("welcome_user", { name })) over concatenation.
- Keep backwards compatibility: if selectedLanguage prop is still passed, it must not conflict; it should effectively be ignored where global context is available.
- If any key is missing in a locale, fallback to English for that key (do not render blanks or “undefined”).
- Do not change styling or business logic except what is required to wire strings.

PHASE 2 - Translation audit + completeness gate (required)
Implement a script at /scripts/i18n-audit.(ts|js) that:
- Loads /i18n/locales/en/common.json as the base.
- For each other locale:
  - lists missing keys
  - lists extra keys
  - computes completeness percentage
- Exits with non-zero code if any locale completeness < 100% OR if any missing keys exist.
  - If 100% is too strict for development, make it configurable:
    - default threshold in dev: 98%
    - required threshold for production build: 100%
- Print a clear report to console.

Also add a lightweight “hard-coded string scan”:
- Grep/scan TSX/JSX in purchaser portal for likely user-facing text nodes and report file:line matches.
- Keep it heuristic (avoid false positives explosion), but it must catch obvious strings.

PHASE 3 - End-to-end verification (required)
Add a short test plan doc (README section or /docs/i18n-testing.md) and perform manual verification:
- Start on each route: Home, Chat, Noticeboard, Docs, Map, Profile
- Switch language and confirm:
  - Nav updates
  - Page updates
  - Modals/toasts/empty states update
- Refresh on a non-home route and confirm persisted language applies.
- Confirm no untranslated UI strings remain (spot check + audit scan).

Accuracy controls (do not skip)
- Review non-English translations for obvious machine-translation errors in high-visibility UI terms (nav labels, primary CTAs, error messages).
- If any translation looks low-confidence or incorrect, replace it with English for that key for that locale until it’s corrected. It is better to show English than a wrong translation.
- Ensure Irish (ga) is appropriate for Ireland (not Scottish Gaelic).

Deliverables
- Migrated components using global t()
- Updated locale files with all keys present
- i18n audit script and scan tooling
- Documentation + confirmation of manual test completion

Proceed now, commit in small logical chunks, and keep the portal functional after each chunk.
