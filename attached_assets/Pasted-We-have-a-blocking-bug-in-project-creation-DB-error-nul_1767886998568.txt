We have a blocking bug in project creation:

DB error: null value in column "organization_id" of relation "projects" violates not-null constraint.

Context:
- Excel parsing works (units + unit types show in Review)
- Failure happens only when pressing "Create Project"
- Existing projects (Longview Park, Rathard Park) have organization_id populated

Goal:
- Make organization_id always set on projects insert.
- Ensure this works for both admin users and super-admin users.
- Do not touch RAG/Smart Archive logic.

Implement the following:

1) Server-side enforcement (required)
- In the projects/create route (the POST handler that inserts into `projects`), set:
  organization_id = derived from authenticated session context.
- Never accept null organization_id.
- Do NOT rely on the frontend payload for organization_id as the sole source of truth.

2) Super-admin behaviour (required)
- If user is super-admin:
  - Use selected organization from the UI (organization picker), OR
  - If none selected, default to the first organization the user has access to.
  - If user has access to multiple orgs and none selected, return a clear error:
    "Select an organisation to create a project."

3) UI support (required if not already present)
- In Create New Project flow (Details step), include an Organization selector ONLY for super-admin.
- For normal org-admin users, the org is implied and hidden.
- Ensure the selected organization_id is carried through to the final POST request.

4) Defensive checks and logging (required)
- Before insert, assert organization_id exists. If missing, return 400 with a clear message.
- Log: user_id, user_email, organization_id, project_name when attempting creation.

5) Tests (recommended)
- Create project as org-admin -> organization_id set automatically.
- Create project as super-admin with org selected -> success.
- Create project as super-admin with no org selected -> returns actionable error, no DB insert attempt.

Deliverables:
- Identify exactly where organization_id was being lost (frontend not sending vs backend not deriving).
- Provide file paths changed.
