You are working in the PropertyAssistant monorepo.

Goal:
Use the existing /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all endpoint to:

1. Backfill embeddings for all existing documents from the Smart Archive.
2. Add an admin only "Reprocess All Documents" control in the Smart Archive UI so developer admins can run this themselves for any development.

Context:

* The endpoint already exists at /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all.
* GET returns stats for documents with and without embeddings.
* POST processes documents in batches and respects development level access control.
* I am using the unified portal Smart Archive view as a developer admin.

Tasks:

1. Wire a minimal Smart Archive admin control

* Find the Smart Archive developer view component, for example something like:

  * apps/unified-portal/app/developer/archive/page.tsx
  * or apps/unified-portal/components/archive/ArchivePage.tsx
* There is already developer context with tenant_id and development_id available in the page. If not, reuse the existing context or hooks you set up earlier for multi development support.

Implement:

* An admin only control, visible only to users with developer level access, for example in the Smart Archive header area.
* The control should show:

  * A "Reprocess All Documents" button.
  * A small text area or badge that shows current stats like "Indexed 12 of 98 documents".
* When the page loads, call the GET /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all endpoint for the current development and show:

  * total documents
  * documents with embeddings
  * documents without embeddings
* When the button is clicked:

  * Call POST /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all for the current development.
  * While processing, disable the button and show a spinner or "Reprocessing…" state.
  * After completion, re call the GET endpoint and update the stats.

Implementation details:

* Use the existing API client patterns already in the app for authenticated calls from the browser to Next API routes.
* The endpoint must always include the current tenant_id and development_id context, but do not hard code specific IDs. Use whatever context or cookies are already used for other developer scoped API calls.
* Handle errors by:

  * Logging to console
  * Showing a simple toast or inline error message, consistent with the existing design system.

2. Make sure the endpoint really runs per development

* Confirm that GET and POST /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all are both filtering by:

  * tenant_id = current tenant
  * development_id = current development
* If the endpoint is currently tenant wide, update it so that:

  * It can take an optional development_id in the request (query or body)
  * It defaults safely to the current development for the logged in developer user.
* Ensure the RLS checks still enforce that a developer only sees or processes developments they are mapped to.

3. Backfill now for current data

* Once the button and stats are wired:

  * In the running app as a developer admin, click "Reprocess All Documents" for the Longview scheme to process all 96 unembedded documents.
* Optionally also provide a small Node script under scripts/ that can trigger POST /developer/api/archive/reprocess-all from the server side for a given development_id so that I have a non UI fallback. This script is optional, the priority is the in app button.

4. Verification

* After reprocessing for Longview:

  * Use the GET endpoint to confirm that the count of documents with embeddings matches the number of active documents, or very close.
  * Confirm that doc_chunks has rows for these documents.
  * Ask the chat assistant a question that clearly needs a drawing or spec and make sure it now answers correctly.

Deliverables:

* Updated React component for Smart Archive with the new admin control.
* Any updates to the reprocess all API route needed to support per development processing.
* Brief summary in comments or replit.md explaining:

  * How the button works.
  * That it is per development and respects access control.
  * How to run it when a new scheme is uploaded.

Please implement everything above and make sure it works end to end without breaking the current Smart Archive or assistant behaviour.
