We are formalising a platform-wide assistant persona for OpenHouse.

This persona must be globally shared, centrally managed, and iterated over time.
All developments must automatically use the currently active persona.

This is a hard requirement for launch.

Implement the following architecture and guardrails.

--------------------------------------------------
1. GLOBAL PERSONA (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
--------------------------------------------------

Create a single global assistant persona object:

OPENHOUSE_ASSISTANT_PERSONA

Key rules:
- There is exactly ONE active persona at runtime.
- All developments consume the active persona.
- No development may own, copy, or override persona logic.

Persona properties:
- version (e.g. v1, v1.1, v2, etc.)
- behaviour rules
- tone and language style
- safety and hallucination controls
- escalation logic
- response formatting conventions
- humour ceiling (very light, optional)

The persona must define ONLY behaviour.
It must NOT contain or reference:
- Any estate (Longview Park, Rathard Park, Rathard Lawn, etc.)
- Any developer
- Any documents
- Any locations
- Any factual data
- Any assumptions about warranties, contractors, systems, or layouts

The persona is development-agnostic and plug-and-play.

--------------------------------------------------
2. RUNTIME INJECTION MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------------

At runtime, every assistant response must be generated as:

Assistant Response =
  OPENHOUSE_ASSISTANT_PERSONA (active)
  + Scheme Configuration
  + Injected Documents (Smart Archive)
  + Available Tools (maps, notices, APIs)

Behaviour MUST come from the persona.
Knowledge MUST come only from injected data.

No scheme-specific knowledge may leak into persona logic.

--------------------------------------------------
3. PERSONA ITERATION & GLOBAL UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------

Persona iteration rules:
- Updating the persona updates behaviour across ALL schemes automatically.
- Existing schemes must NOT be frozen on old persona versions.
- There is no per-scheme persona selection.

Versioning exists for:
- Auditability
- Rollback if needed
- Change tracking

NOT for:
- Running multiple personas in parallel
- Scheme-specific behaviour divergence

When the persona is updated:
- Increment the version
- Deploy
- All schemes immediately reflect the change

--------------------------------------------------
4. STRICT PROHIBITIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

The system must NOT allow the following:

- Copying persona text into scheme configuration
- Embedding persona logic inside estate setup flows
- “Fixing” assistant behaviour locally for one scheme
- Hardcoding behaviour differences per development
- Training or tuning the assistant differently per estate

Persona logic must exist in ONE place only.

--------------------------------------------------
5. DEVELOPER & ESTATE DATA SEPARATION
--------------------------------------------------

Data layers must remain cleanly separated:

A) Global Persona
- Behaviour only

B) Developer Document Library (optional, per developer)
- Reusable docs across that developer’s estates only
- Never shared across different developers

C) Estate-Specific Data
- Architectural plans
- House types
- Unit metadata
- Location and branding
- Notices

Persona behaviour must never depend on which layer data comes from.

--------------------------------------------------
6. GUARDRAILS & DEFENSIVE CHECKS
--------------------------------------------------

Add the following safeguards:

- Hard fail if OPENHOUSE_ASSISTANT_PERSONA is missing at runtime
- Log error if persona logic is duplicated anywhere else
- Block any attempt by a scheme to override persona behaviour
- Graceful error messaging if documents or scheme data are missing
- Clear separation between behaviour errors and data errors

--------------------------------------------------
7. RATHARD LAWN AS VALIDATION CASE
--------------------------------------------------

Rathard Lawn will be onboarded using:
- The global persona
- The same developer document library as Longview Park and Rathard Park
- Different architectural plans and branding only

Its similarity must NOT influence persona behaviour.

--------------------------------------------------
8. FUTURE-PROOFING (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)
--------------------------------------------------

Design the persona system so that in the future we could add:
- Persona rollback if a release causes issues
- Staged rollout (optional enterprise feature)
- Persona changelog for internal review

Do NOT implement these yet.
Just ensure the architecture does not block them.

--------------------------------------------------
9. SCOPE CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------

Do not refactor unrelated code.
Do not change existing live behaviour.
Do not introduce new abstractions unless required.

This is a structural isolation and guardrail exercise,
not a redesign.

Confirm once this architecture is enforced.
