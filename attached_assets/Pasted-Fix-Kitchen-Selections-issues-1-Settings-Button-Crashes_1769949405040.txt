Fix Kitchen Selections issues:
1. Settings Button Crashes
The Settings button in Kitchen Selections is causing an error. Please fix:

Add try/catch error handling
Make sure the settings modal/page loads correctly
The settings should allow editing PC sum amounts and dropdown options

2. Add PC Sum Column to Kitchen Selections Table
The table is missing the PC Sum Impact column. Add it after the Wardrobes column:
| Unit | Address | Purchaser | Type | Kitchen | Counter | Cabinet | Handle | Wardrobes | PC Sum | Notes |
PC Sum column should show:

"€0" (grey text) if taking developer kitchen & wardrobes
"-€6,000" (red text) if taking own kitchen (3 bed)
"-€7,000" (red text) if taking own kitchen (4 bed)
"-€8,000" (red text) if taking own kitchen AND wardrobes (4 bed)
etc.

The data is already in the database in pc_sum_total column - just needs to be displayed.
Format:

Negative amounts in red: -€7,000
Zero in grey: €0
Show "—" if kitchen_selected is NULL (not decided yet)

3. Add Total PC Sum Deductions Summary Card
Add a summary card at the top showing the total PC sum impact for the development:
┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│ Selection Progress│  │ Taking Kitchen   │  │ Taking Own       │  │ PC Sum Deductions│
│   39 of 68       │  │   26 (67%)       │  │   13 (33%)       │  │  -€80,000        │
│   (57% complete) │  │                  │  │                  │  │  (13 units)      │
└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
PC Sum Deductions card should show:

Total sum of all pc_sum_total values for the development (will be negative)
Count of units with deductions (where pc_sum_total < 0)
Red text for the amount since it's a deduction

Query to get this:
sqlSELECT 
    SUM(pc_sum_total) as total_deductions,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pc_sum_total < 0) as units_with_deductions
FROM unit_sales_pipeline 
WHERE development_id = '{developmentId}'
AND pc_sum_total < 0;
For Árdan View this should show: -€39,000 (6 units)
