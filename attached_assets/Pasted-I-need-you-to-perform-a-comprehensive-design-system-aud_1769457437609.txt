I need you to perform a comprehensive design system audit of this codebase and output a complete design specification document. This will be used to create a design system reference for another AI tool, so be exhaustive and precise.

## What to Extract

### 1. Design Tokens
Scan all CSS files, Tailwind config, tailwind-preset.js, theme files, and any design token files for:

- **Colors**: Every color value used, organized by purpose (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic colors like success/error/warning). Include the exact hex/rgb values and any CSS variable names.
- **Typography**: Font families (with fallbacks), font sizes, line heights, font weights, letter spacing. Note which fonts are used for headings vs body text.
- **Spacing**: Any custom spacing scale or common spacing values used throughout.
- **Border Radius**: All radius values and where each is typically used.
- **Shadows**: Every box-shadow definition, named if possible.
- **Transitions/Animations**: All easing curves (cubic-bezier values), durations, and any keyframe animations defined.
- **Breakpoints**: Media query breakpoints for responsive design.
- **Z-index scale**: If there's a defined z-index system.

### 2. Component Patterns
Find examples of these components in the codebase and extract the exact className strings or styled-component definitions:

- Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost, disabled states)
- Cards (standard, glass/frosted, interactive)
- Input fields (text, select, textarea - including focus states)
- Navigation elements
- Modals/dialogs
- Tables/data display
- Stat cards or dashboard widgets
- Alert/notification components
- Loading states/skeletons
- Any glass-morphism or blur effects

### 3. Layout Patterns
- Common container widths
- Grid systems used
- Common flex patterns
- Page layout structures

### 4. Icon Usage
- What icon library is used (Lucide, Heroicons, custom SVGs)?
- Standard icon sizes
- Icon styling conventions

### 5. Interactive States
For buttons, links, cards, and inputs, document:
- Default state
- Hover state
- Focus state
- Active/pressed state
- Disabled state

## Output Format

Structure your output as a single markdown document with code blocks showing the exact values. For component patterns, include the full className strings or CSS exactly as they appear in the codebase.

Example format for a button:
```tsx
// Primary Button - from [filename]
className="bg-gold-400 text-white font-medium px-6 py-3 rounded-lg shadow-gold transition-all duration-250 ease-premium hover:bg-gold-500 hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5 active:translate-y-0"
```

## Important
- Include EXACT values, not approximations
- Note which file each pattern comes from
- If there are inconsistencies in the codebase, flag them
- Include any CSS custom properties (--variable-name) definitions
- Don't skip anything - completeness is critical
