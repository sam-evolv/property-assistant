You are the Senior Frontend Systems Architect responsible for Phase 16 of the OpenHouse AI build.
Execute Phase 16: Enterprise & Developer Portal Visual Overhaul.

Your mandate is to completely refresh the Developer Portal and Super Admin Enterprise Portal with a unified, premium, modern visual identity aligned with Phase 15’s Resident App polish. Apply a consistent theme, typography system, spacing scale, component library standards, and micro-interaction rules across every screen.

Maintain full multi-tenant isolation and never break backend logic.

Caption and metric text

Spacing scale (4/8/12/20/32/48 px)

Line heights

Section padding rules

Apply globally.

3. DASHBOARD & LAYOUT REBUILD

Every dashboard should follow a uniform structure:

Top row: Insight Cards

Second row: Charts/Grid visualisation

Third row: DataTables, logs, lists

Persistent sidebar nav with active-state indicators

Section headers with breadcrumb

4. COMPONENT POLISH

Upgrade all components to premium quality:

Replace every div-based card with InsightCard

Replace every table with DataTable

Add pagination + filtering to all tables

Add skeleton loaders for all charts & tables

Add subtle micro-interactions on hover, click, tab change

Add shimmer loading states on analytic panels

5. NAVIGATION OVERHAUL

Fix both portals:

Add active route highlighting

Add icons per nav item

Add larger tap targets

Add section grouping

Add consistent safe-area padding

Improve top-level breadcrumbs

6. CHARTS & DATA VISUALISATION POLISH

All charts must use the new premium theme

Replace harsh colours with soft gold, charcoal, grey

Add subtle animation on load

Add legends and axis labels

Add empty states

7. FULL RESPONSIVE REBUILD

Ensure no horizontal scrolling at any viewport.

8. CLEAN-UP & CONSISTENCY

Delete old layout fragments

Remove old stylesheets and blue themes

DELIVERABLES
A. Global Theme Provider

B. Refactored Layout Components

/developer/layout.tsx

C. Complete rewrite of all dashboard screens

Every screen must be visually premium and consistent.

D. Full regression test

Confirm all analytics pages, charts, tables, maps, and settings pages compile and function after the visual overhaul.

CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT modify backend logic or RAG behaviour.

Do NOT remove or break analytics endpoints.

Never break tenant isolation.

Keep the Resident App untouched (that was Phase 15).
