REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (ADD 6 VIBRANT DEMO NOTICEBOARD POSTS, MULTIPLE RESIDENT AUTHORS, NO BREAKAGE)

Objective
Add 6 additional demo noticeboard posts authored by different made-up residents of OpenHouse Park to make the estate feel vibrant. Must appear in the purchaser Noticeboard UI for demo code OH-PARK-009. Must not affect production tenants.

Constraints
- Only insert posts for the DEMO tenant/development/unit (OpenHouse Park, OH-PARK-009).
- Keep seed idempotent: running `npm run seed:demo` multiple times must not duplicate posts.
- Do not change auth/RLS behaviour, and do not require any manual DB steps.

Implementation
1) Identify the exact noticeboard table and columns currently used by the purchaser Noticeboard API.
   - Use the same linkage keys as existing seeded posts (tenant_id / development_id / unit_id as applicable).
2) Update `scripts/seed-demo.ts` (or the demo seed module) to upsert these 6 posts.
   - Use deterministic IDs (valid UUIDs) or a unique natural key (e.g., slug) so idempotency is guaranteed.
   - If the table has a unique constraint you can leverage (e.g., (development_id, title)), use it.
3) Ensure posts have realistic created_at timestamps across the last 2–3 weeks (staggered) so the feed feels alive.
4) Include “author_name” or equivalent field if it exists. If not, add an optional author field only if additive and the UI/API can already read it. If the schema doesn’t support author_name, include the resident name in the post title or first line of body (do not break schema).
5) Verify the Noticeboard UI shows all posts (existing + new) and they render correctly on mobile.

Create these 6 posts (use exactly these names and content unless you need to adjust field lengths)

- Title: “Dog walking group - weekday evenings?”
- Body: “Would anyone be interested in a small dog walking group on weekday evenings around 7pm? Could be a handy way to meet people and get steps in. [Brian - Unit 6]”

Acceptance criteria
- Running `npm run seed:demo` results in these 6 posts being present exactly once.
- Posts appear in the purchaser Noticeboard feed for OH-PARK-009.
- Posts are clearly attributed to residents either via author field or within the body.
- No changes to production tenants, no schema breaking migrations, no duplicated posts.

After implementation
- Run `npm run seed:demo`
- Open purchaser portal for OH-PARK-009
- Confirm Noticeboard shows the new posts.

Proceed now.
